    - 1/ When I started my journey as a creator, I was held back by the idea of finding my niche or personal monopoly. 

I was totally sold by @david_perell's framing of this valuable thing, but I believed that I couldn't create until I found it. 

I felt trapped by it.

I was wrong ðŸ‘‡

    - 2/ I began taking Twitter seriously in Sept 2019 and at some point came across @visakanv.

Visa has a 'memex' in his profile banner image that contains the words "be so prolific that you don't recognise yourself."

That was the solution to my problem.

    - 3/ This is linked to the "do 100 things" idea that you don't know a thing until you've performed 100 iterations of it.

I realised that I had been thinking about my niche completely backwards.

It's not something you choose, it's something you discover.

    - 4/ The analogy in my mind is one of an Architect vs an Archeologist.

The Architect designs the building up front before construction can begin. The design may be adapted along the way as things come up during construction, but the frame is that the building follows the design. https://t.co/T1UqZX5036 
    - 5/ The Archeologist, on the other hand, discovers something hidden underground, makes some guesses about what it might be, and then starts the process of uncovering it. 

Whenever the truth of what they find differs from their idea, they update their idea of what they've found. https://t.co/CMIxfEbCwS 
    - 6/ I realised I was seeing my creative journey through the lens of an architect rather than an archeologist, trying to design it rather than discover it.

Now that I've made that reframe, I'm free to create, safe in the knowledge that the more I create, the more I'll discover. 
    - 7/ The fate I want to avoid as a creator is to force my way into a box that I hate living in. 

By letting my niche emerge, it's much more likely that I'll enjoy the journey and the destination.

This is a cornerstone idea to me, so I made a video of it.

    - 8/ Oh, and in the spirit of the thing:
