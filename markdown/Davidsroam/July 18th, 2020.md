    - I have done some more work on my #[[Booklists]] page

    - [[Kerstin]] and Susanne are in town. They will have lunch with Amanda, do shopping for dinner and go with her to the Kvillinge farmstall.
- I have spent all morning working on the methods described on the #[[Booklists]] page. Fun, but always takes more time than expected. I managed to do  the following:
    - Create a  textfile with a complete list of books on [[Calibre]] using the [[Calibre]]db CLI.  Import the textfile to Excel, save as Excel and from there import to Notion.
    - Create a textfile with a complete list of books and other media from Readdle Documents. I still need to write a Python program to filter the textfile so that I can import it to Excel and from there to Notion. As part of this, I need to decide how I want to deal with video and audio files.
