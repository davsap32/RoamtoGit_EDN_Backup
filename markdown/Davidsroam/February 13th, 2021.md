    - [[Samuel]] called this morning from [[Cape Town]], he had a hotel booking for yesterday evening with Hotels.com, it turned out that the hotel he had booked had been closed for more than a year. Hotels.com tried to help him find a new booking for the night, but hotels did not accept new bookings after 21:00. He ended up sleeping in the cellar at [[7 Finchley]]. He has booked a hotel for this evening and will walk on Victoria Road by the beach and eat lunch there. The rest of the day and this evening he will be with [[Esther]].
