    - Listening to a #Podcast on the  [[How to Academy]] channel with [[Ian McGilchrist]] entitled "The divided brain and the Search for meaning. About the roles and functions of the two hemispheres and what we can know from that about human behaviour. Ian McGilchrist has written a book [[The Master and His Emissary - The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World]] which may be worth reading. #Books
    - Watched a #youtube #Video on advice for writers by [[Ernest Hemingway]]. I'd like to read more of his advice as well as his books. #Books
