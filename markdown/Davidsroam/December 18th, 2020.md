    - Skipped whm due to hip pain, the cause of which i suspect is too much sitting with crossed legs. My hip feels better today, the second day of not doing whm. #Illness
    - Did not feel up to cold [[bathing]] today, tomorrow [[Cecilia]] and [[Carl-Otto]]will come to lunch, Cecilia is interested in [[bathing]] then somhopefully I will bathe with her tomorrow.
    - Watched an interesting video about not consuming more content than you can process. Spend 80% pf your time processing content and 20% consuming it.
