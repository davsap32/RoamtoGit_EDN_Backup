- Nick Milo's email:
    - You're in, my modern friend.
    - You took a leap of faith on me—I don't take it for granted—and I hope to provide you mega-insights and inspiration.
    - With **[[Linking Your Thinking]]**, my prime directive is helping you get more joy out of your digital notes.
    - This is an exciting time in "Personal Knowledge Management".
    - We now have the power to create something wonderfully meaningful—to us—and the people in our orbit.
    - You're going to be at home here. Especially if:
        - You don't want to lose thoughts
        - You might want to build and create things
        - You are an independent thinker and interested in many things
    - And perhaps most importantly: **__You find thinking to be inherently valuable__**.
    - I think you can already tell... this will be fresh and different compared to what you normally see.
    - That's because it won't be about:
        - Rigid systems
        - The latest apps
        - Hyper [[Productivity]]
        - Fragile automations and over-optimizations
    - So...
    - If you're tired of switching apps and chasing the shiny stuff—and you're ready to regain a sense of trust and mastery with your digital notes...
    - And you're okay with putting in the work...
    - Then I promise you, that you can end 2020 victorious—staring at your own personalized, antifragile, flexible, future-proof PKM system.
    - It will be a system that can give you **peace of mind** and **tremendous joy**.
    - It will be a system you can **create **and** grow **with—**over decades**.
    - I've got so much cooked up to share with you...I'm so excited! I almost want to double-promise and say, "you will experience game-changers...more than one."

    - What's Next?
    - Between me typing the first word and clicking publish was only 36 hours. Not bad for a recovering perfectionist! The article is fine to get the party started, but now I need to add the nuance.
    - My article "Why Progressive Summarization Must Die" caused quite the stir.​
    - Just a few minutes ago, I dropped some of that nuance as a tweet thread titled ["The Effects of Linguistic Interference". Check it out!](https://el2.convertkit-mail2.com/c/4zugvke9krsehw50retx/p8ho2lxds9h7vxq8mo/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9OaWNrTWlsby9zdGF0dXMvMTI5NzU4OTU3NDkwMjg0OTUzNj9zPTIw)​
    - How Can I Best Serve You?
    - What's one problem you're trying to solve with your note-taking/making system? Reply back right here. I read every email.
- My answer:
    - Hi Nick,
    - Thanks for your email.
    - You ask how you can best serve me.
        - I have no idea. As far as I know, you have not described any kind of offering, apart from the phrase "Start linking your thinking", which does awaken my curiosity.
    - You ask me to describe one problem I'm trying to solve with my note-taking system.
        - I don't think it's that simple, that I define a specific problem which you then solve.
    - I can describe my undertaking, perhaps this may help.
        - I am on a journey of exploration, the territory to be explored includes the following:
            - **[[Creativity]]**: Producing original work
            - **[[Productivity]]**: Getting things done
            - **Knowledge**: Finding useful information that can be trusted and making use of it.
            - **[[Philosophy]]**: The search for meaning.
        - This exploration cannot be pursued without writing things down. On the other hand, I am wary of oversystematizing the work of writing. I think that the concept "PKM" is already going too far, the implication being that knowledge of this kind can be managed. The risk is that the system becomes an end in itself.
        - I am doing this work on my own, using books, blogs, articles, videos, podcasts  etc as input. Conversations with others may be helpful, this remains to be seen.
        - My writing tool is Roam.
    - I would appreciate it if you would explain what you are offering. In your email it seems as if you assume that I have accepted your offer, but of course that cannot be the case, as I don't know what it is.
