    - [[Kerstin]] is on her way to [[Arboga]] to spend time with [[Lizzie]]. 
    - Windy today - I have postponed thoughts of [[bathing]] until after lunch.
    - Yesterday evening, I read a list of book recommendations from [[lithub.com]]. [Link](https://lithub.com/our-65-favorite-books-of-the-year/). I could find a number of the books, so my reading list has grown again. #Books

    - Watching a section of [[Annie Leibovitz]] masterclass on photography, about working with people. She recommends for aspiring photographers to start by photographing people they know well, who willl put up with them - close family, for example. She talks about her book [[A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005]] which contains photographs of her own famliy as well as well-known people. I would reall like to get hold of that book. #Books #Photography
