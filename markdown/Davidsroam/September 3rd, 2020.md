    - Yesterday evening I started reading [[One Blade of Grass]]. Seems to be an interesting story of a troubled boy with eczema who has glimpses of the transcendent and later in life becomes a Zen practitioner. #Books
    - Rainy weather. [[Valy]] called to say that he would not come today, it is too damp to paint. He will come tomorrow if the weather improves.
    - [[Kerstin]] will fetch [[Leo]] today and take him for a haircut. She will probably come home with him and we will eat dinner together.
    - My reading for my #[[Capstone Project]] has mostly been within the area of #[[Psychology]]. I need to read more within the area of #Philosophy. I intend to read [[Bertrand Russell]]'s book [[History of Western Philosophy]]. This a large and challenging book, so it will be a big task. #Books
    - Called #[[Alina systems]] to find out status of [[Desktop repair]]. They are still waiting for a new SSD, it should come today or tomorrow.
    - Today I received the copy of [[The Book of Not]] which I ordered from [[Bokus]]. Looking forward to reading it. #Books
    - Watching SVT kulturnytt. Trailer for the film ”[[I’m thinking of ending things]]”. I’d like to see it. On Netflix from [[September 6th, 2020]] #Films

    - I have booked a dentist’s appointment for [[September 4th, 2020]] at 10:00. It feels as if a tooth is broken and is a little painful to chew on (upper jaw, right side, at the back.)

    - [[Kerstin]] came home with [[Leo]], after fetching him from school and taking him for a haircut. He is such a pleasure to be with when it is just us and him. 
    - Spoke briefly with [[Esther]], she seems to think that it is a burden for me to talk with her daily, so she tries to keep our conversations short.
    - Read a few more pages of [[One Blade of Grass]]. I really like it.  #Books
