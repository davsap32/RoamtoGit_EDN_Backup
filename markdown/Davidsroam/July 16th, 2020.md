    - Yesterday evening I wote to NYT on messenger that I wanted to cancel my subscription and had been unable to do so due to long queues to the customer service chat. They cancelled my subscription directly, mission accomplished.
    - Yesterday Joakim turned up to complete his work with our paving stones. He levelled the stones outside [[Kerstin]]'s atelj√© and pressure washed the stones on our paths.

    - I have gone back to my Notion database and looked at what I might need in Roam. I also tested exporting from Notion to Roam. So far, I cannot get a page containing other pages which in their turn contain links (to web pages) to export and import correctly. The links no longer work . I am able to export links into Notion, so I can maintain Notion pages to which I can link from Roam. In that case, I will not get the bidirectional linking.
    - When I move more complex pages from Notion to Roam, it will involve a lot of manual work. I should be careful about what I import and how I fit it in to what is already there.  
    - I registered today with Nat Eliason's Roam course, so the best strategy might be to follow the course before dumping lots of stuff in the database. It is however difficult to learn without doing at the same time, so it will be a combination.
