    - Reply from [[Dagmar]] - nice to hear from them.
    - Saw an interview with [[Åsa Linderborg]] on Babel yesterday evening, she talked about her book [[Året med 13 månader]]. It is based on a diary written by a newspaper culture editor at the time of the meeto movement, which is interesting. Also, I'm curious about how people write diaries. So I'd like to read the book #Books

    - It seems that metadata including  develop settings and ratings is missing from a large number of lightroom photos. There are also duplicates for many photos. There is potentially a lot of work involved in recreating all of this. I can begin by comparing the contents of my lightroom catalogs with corresponding [[SmugMug]] galleries. This has to be done for thousands of photos. #[[Lightroom Cleanup]]

    - Thinking about Stoic philosophy - change the things you can change, accept the things you cannot change. Not deep enough, the important question is who is the "you" that can or cannot change something. #Philosophy

    - I had two meetings around lunchtime with a half hour between them. Asked [[Kerstin]] to organise so that I could come up and eat between my meetings - which she agreed to do and then forgot. I was pissed off when I came up after the first meeting to discover that nothing had been prepared.  Such is life.
