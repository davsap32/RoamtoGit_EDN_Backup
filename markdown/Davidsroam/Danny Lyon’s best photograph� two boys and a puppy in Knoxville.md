    - “People used to ask me why I was attracted to the outskirts of a society. But what was I supposed to photograph in suburbia? I find it stunningly boring. When I was growing up, it was all businessmen in drab flannel suits and fedoras who cared only about making money.”
    - “What has always interested me is emotion, and the first thing that happens when you ascend to the business class is you conceal your emotions.

I find something hateful about that world.”
