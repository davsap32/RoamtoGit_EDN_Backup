    - Considering whether to subscribe to [[Dropbox]]. Sync with [[Edraw]] apps on [[Ipad]] needs dropbox, [[OneDrive]] does not seem to work. Do I need [[Dropbox]] for this purpose? For any other purpose? I cannot install [[Dropbox]] on my desktop PC without subscribing.
        - [[OneDrive]] doesn't work with Edraw. but [[Box]] does. I'll stick to [[Box]] for the time being. Their free plan includes 10 GB of storage, which is more than enough for my purposes.
