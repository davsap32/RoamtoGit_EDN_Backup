    - I am determined to find an expression of zettelkasten that makes sense to me. 

An idea management system that "just works".
One that allows me to sink into a state of ordered *flow*. https://t.co/AWftjMIH33 
        - **Note**: Thread
    - Had a chance today to finally review the nuances of @beauhaan's system thanks to his interview with @RobertHaisfield.

The proposed system doesn't *quite* scratch my itch, but it was quite generative for ideas and inspiration.

    - I'm not building a traditional system. This won't be Luhmann's slipbox. My approach with be unorthodox — but it will work for my brain.

Rather than a "zettelkasten", what I'm *really* looking for is a universal idea management system.

The "non-actionable" companion to GTD. 
    - This is my current framing. Which is quite close to the traditional — with the inclusion of QUESTIONS as a central component to the system. https://t.co/f1vvhVqCh1 
    - Questions drive the progress. Too much certainty feels arrogant to me. I know nothing!! 

I want to be able to capture my curiosity and uncertainty in my knowledge system. To set up a self-volleying dialogue between statement and question. Assertion and nuance-seeking inquisition 
    - First the category of "fleeting" (which still feels like a mis-nomer to me...)

Fleeting is the "not anchored to source material" stuff. The shower thoughts, drifting ideas, epiphanies while walking. They have NO DIRECT SOURCE. 

Mis-nomer because I don't see them as "fleeting". https://t.co/DZX2sMiKc5 
    - Next "literature" (again, mis-nomer — "literature" feels to narrowed to *written* work)

These are "in your own words" summaries of the AUTHOR'S assertions. Not your own ideas. 

They could come from any content I engage with (articles, tweets, books, podcasts, etc) https://t.co/ZWai61Erds 
    - Then "permanent" (again, misnomer — "permanent" feels too rigid and fixed...) 

These are notes that TRANSCEND a single source. They are approaching original idea. The unite various sources into a felt truth. A statement/assertion.

These achieve "page reference" status. https://t.co/QO4Wt0wXEJ 
    - I feel nit-picky on the terminology, but WORDS ARE IMPORTANT. 

These feel close, but not quite hitting the right intention. 

fleeting ~ independent
literature ~ summary
permanent ~ "zettel" 
    - There are also a few "non-central" notes that are important...

reference = the source details and metadata.
relevant = relating to the permanent notes, these are RELEVANT connections.
verbatim = not my words. Some things are OK to file in their non-original form. https://t.co/GlrZqUUYAz 
    - And finally, the "creative projects" — the star of the show. The outputs that the zettelkasten generates.

The workflow here feels like 
1) Capture ideas
2) Mature ideas into outlines (by browsing the zettelkasten)
3) Mature outlines into bodied works (through elaboration) 
    - Continued... https://t.co/2fDC5d9BcP
