    - I recorded 130 podcast interviews and had little traction. 

This is what I've learnt about finding your niche online a.k.a. specific knowledge, personal monopoly, unique authenticity, etc.

Here's what I should have done differently.

THREAD 
        - **Note**: Thread
    - 1/ Be different.

Choose a combination of topics that are unique to you that no one else has ever combined. 

By combining 2-3 topics you're interest in with your passion and personality, you will land on your sweet spot. Be different and you will eventually find an audience. 
    - 2/ Be relevant.

Include a topic that is small but growing in popularity.

These are commonly found in emerging industries and technologies or could be an untapped historical figure. Share what you learn in public and take people on your journey. 
    - - Check out sites like Exploding Topics, Yahoo Answers, Quora and AnswerThePublic. 

- See what's trending on Twitter, Buzzsumo, and Google Trends. 

- Search for phrases like “I wish I could do…” or “I hate…” 
    - 3/ Don't ignore what's tried and true.

Overlap with a topic that's covered by many other successful blogs. A new take on an existing topic is one way to ensure there's demand. Also check to see if it's covered by forums, Facebook groups and other online communities. 
    - 4/ Bring what you're good at.

Include both hard and soft skills. Teaching attracts an audience. So teach by sharing your knowledge, your experiences and your epiphanies. 

E.g. a hard skill could be what you've learned at University or books e.g. geology or creative writing. 
    - A soft skill could be something you picked up at work like sales, public speaking, personal productivity or writing. 

If it's a skill that other people can use to make money then even better. 
    - 5/ Passion is essential. 

It takes persistence. Create for months and let your passion be your engine. 

Passion is what you think about in the shower. It's what you can't not do. It's what you talk to someone about on long car journeys. 
    - 6/ You don't choose your niche. It chooses you. 

Establish a system to share consistently, invite feedback and improve over time. Soon you will discover the intersection between demand from the market and what you're interested in. That is your niche. 
    - Anything to add my friends? 

I invite you to post in your own ideas or other threads that add to this topic. It's the resource I never had.

    - Oh and, map your personal constellation.

Your personal constellation is made up of all the experiences, perspectives, beliefs, skills and achievements in your life. 

Connect as many of them as possible as a starting point You have to start somewhere.
