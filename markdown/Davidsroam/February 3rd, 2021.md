    - Spoke with [[Esther]] yesterday evening about acquiring an ECG monitor, which she feels she needs as she has not had her yearly checkup with her cardiologist, being unwilling to risk infection. [[Esther]] will ask her cardiologist what monitors she can recommend. It might be possible to get hold of an Apple watch series 5 in the shops to send with [[Samuel]]. Waiting for the Cardiologist's answer.
    - We also spoke about the problem with electric fuses tripping. An electrician has looked at the fuse box and cut a wire that seemed to be connected to a faulty device. When he did so, the pool motor no longer started. [[Esther]] now believes that the connection to the pool motor, which turns on at around 09:15 daily, is behind the tripping of the fuse. She has asked the electrician to come back and check out the pool motor.
    - Yesterday evening, I checked a number of book reviews and decided that the next book I will read will be [[Transcendent Kingdom]].
