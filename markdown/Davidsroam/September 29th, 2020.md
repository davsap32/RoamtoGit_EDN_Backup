    - Finished reading [[The Lessons of History]]. 
    - Read a few pages of [[This Life]], put it aside. I didn't find the author's arguments convincing. Maybe another time.
    - Read a few pages of [[The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey to Mastery]], put it aside. Itäs for people working as programmers, which I am not at the moment.
    - Read a few pages of [[Happy Together]]. There seems to be a problem with the [[Calibre]] conversion from Epub to Mobi. The Epub version is allright, but the Mobi version lacks the first part of the opening sentence in each chapter. I'll read a bit in the Epub version and see if I want to read on. #Books
    - Started reading [[The Big Picture]]. Seems interesting. #Books
    - Watched part of the film [[The Two Popes]] together with [[Kerstin]] yesterday evening - very well acted by Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce. [[Films]]
    - Having resumed [[Touch Typing]] training, I became curious as to whether it is possible to import texts to the [[Typesy]] app. After some searching, I discovered that this can indeed be done, under Play/Standard Activities/Typing Lesson. The choice of text to used for practice is via a link at the top right of the window:

        - There are large numbers of texts to practice with and it is possible to import texts to add to the list.

    - I had an appointment with the oral hygienist, he scraped off some plaque. He thought I was brushing my teeth too hard, they showed some signs of damage. He recommended using only three fingers to hold the toothbrush (he must mean two fingers and a thumb).
    - Went #bathing - the sun came out while I was on the way down to [[Lillsjön]]. I was in 3:10 minutes without discomfort.
    - [[Kerstin]] had lunch with a friend in town, she is visiting [[Amanda]] and will come home later.
- 16:53
    - Completed processing highlights from [[The Lessons of History]].
- 21:13
    - Read a few more pages of [[Happy Together]] after which I put it aside, I found the style gushing and longwinded. #Books
    - Instead, started reading [[Twilight of Democracy]], which seems interesting. #Books
