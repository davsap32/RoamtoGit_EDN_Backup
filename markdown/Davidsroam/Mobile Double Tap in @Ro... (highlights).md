    - Mobile double tap in @RoamResearch, I really needed this quality of life improvement!

- exclude filters
- "right click" on bullets

Who wants to try? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

    - Bullet right-clicking was a tougher cookie:

- it's a "contextmenu" and not a "click" or "touch" event

- small bullet size, you can easily tap on different elements around it

- still has to work for single taps

- tap location matters to position the menu around it 
    - Install this (if you did previously, you should update the code)
