- The active practices I have at the moment are:
    - WHM breathing
    - Meditation
    - Cold [[bathing]]
    - Journaling
    - Physical training.
    - Intermittent fasting
    - Reading 
        - Including, for non-fiction, highlighting and processing highlights.
- Possible new practices to cultivate:
    - Financial management
        - I have money to invest privately and in Riscom
    - Visualisation techniques such as those described in [[WOOP]] and [[The Tools]]
    - Creative writing as described in [[Writing Down the Bones]]
        - If I were to establish a writing practice, I could potentially have much use of my #Evergreens
        - A similar practice to [[Writing Down the Bones]] is what [[Jed McKenna]] called "Spiritual Autophagy"
    - Implementing the principles described in [[Deep Work]], [[Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day]], [[Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results]] and [[Peak_ Secrets from the New Science of Expertise]]. I feel that I have already done this to some extent.
    - Additional breathing practices for example based on the book [[The Oxygen Advantage: The Simple, Scientifically Proven Breathing Techniques for a Healthier, Slimmer, Faster, and Fitter You]]
- Practices which have previously been important to me and which have become inactive or much less active
    - #Photography
        - I don’t feel that I am finished with photography, although I am quite sure that I do not want to do street photography. I don’t feel drawn to landscape photography either.
        - I should look at other people’s pictures for a while, and see if I become inspired to choose a direction for the near future. 
        - Taking pictures of family is not going to give me enough practice to develop my skills.
        - I would like to document some group or activity as part of a photography project. 
            - Am I prepared to make the necessary investment in time and effort to do this?
            - Other alternatives?
    - Yoga 
        - not high prio for me at this stage - PT is enough
    - Aikido 
        - this was many years ago, I’m not going to go back to it
- New practices take time and effort to establish. I feel I'm doing quite well to regularly do the active practices that I have. I don't want to schedule my days beyond a reasonable level.
