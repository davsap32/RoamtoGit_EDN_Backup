    - Went [[bathing]] - there were two groups of young people [[bathing]] at Lillsjön, which is unusual. Our neighbours [[Johan]] and [[Elin]] came past with their children - they were out walking.
    - While preparing food, I listened to a #Podcast with [[Robert Salzman]] and [[Shiv Sengupta]] - an interesting and open conversation about existence itself. 
    - I met [[Samuel]] at Norrköpings Plattsättning, where he bought a glass wall for his shower. Drove then to his house and helped him to carry it up to the new shower room on the second floor.
