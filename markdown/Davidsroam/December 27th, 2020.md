    - Still enjoying reading [[Tokyo Underworld]] - describing the corruption which was endemic in Japanese society during the rebuilding of the country after the second world war. #Books
    - Went out for a short walk with [[Kerstin]] today - decided not to go #bathing, as it was very windy.
    - Made a tasty ceviche of salmon.

    - Checking out new functionality for roam templates: (using ;;). [Link to video description](https://www.loom.com/share/9553be500a904724b0f0a7652fa707bc) [[Roam Research]]
        - I have created a page titled roam/templates and added a **daily plan** template, which should mean that I can use the template in [[Roam Research]] going forward, rather than in [[Breevy]]. So I can use the template on my [[Ipad]] as well as my PC. 
        - There is a problem with this: for the habit tracker attribute table to work as intended, the habit tracker keywords may not be indented - they must be on the same level as the daily page title. This can work if I add the day's date as the top level title for the daliy plan.
