    - [[Kerstin]] fetched [[Leo]] and [[Ellen]] this afternoon and we went on an outing with them to the forest above [[Hults Bruk]]. We ate muffins and looked for mushrooms, which we found a few of.

    - This evening [[Samuel]], [[Josefine]] and [[Alice]] came for dinner. We talked about [[Samuel]]’s plans to travel to [[Cape Town]] at the end of October to help a team of four developers get started with their new assignments for [[Angry Creative]]. Several developers have resigned from the new daughter company in UK, so [[Samuel]]’s idea is to employ developers in [[South Africa]] where the web development market is depressed due to the pandemic and many developers are looking for work.
    - I asked [[Samuel]] if he knew where I could find out about product recommendations for electric radiators, we need to put in new ones throughout the house. His friend [[Henrik]] has researched this question for his own house, [[Samuel]] has asked him to provide info on his conclusions.
