    - New area #[[Personal Finance]] #Areas
    - Watching a video by [[Ali Abdaal]] on [[youtube]]. [Link](https://youtu.be/bpikCLhpIRY). He talks about #[[Evergreens]] which are the most valuable extracts from highlights and notes from [[Books]], [[Podcast]] etc. These are collected under headings aligned with [[Areas]] (he calls his #[[Evergreens]] collection "Tree of Life"). Here, the notes are not sorted by source as previously but by area.

    - Based on watching [[Ali Abdaal]]s video, I signed up for a subscription for [[Nebula]], which is a streaming platform for educators, where [[Ali Abdaal]] posts material on [[Roam Research]], [[Productivity]], #[[Digital Garden]] and other things. Based on his recommendation I will listen to a [[Podcast]] with [[Samantha Ryan]] and [[Naval Ravikant]]

    - Finished reading [[The Motion of the Body Through Space]], which I really enjoyed. #Books I Have to decide what to read next.
    - I watched one of [[Ali Abdaal]]s videos on [[Nebula]], about #[[Evergreens]]. He referred to [[[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)]] who has done a lot of work in this field. Something to look in to. #[[Digital Garden]].
    - I like [[Ali Abdaal]]'s idea of labelling a link, book title, podcast etc as a "nibble". I will use the term #Inbox, i,e information that I should consume (he uses the term "digest"). [Link](https://watchnebula.com/videos/ali-abdaal-workflow-18-the-nibble-framework)
