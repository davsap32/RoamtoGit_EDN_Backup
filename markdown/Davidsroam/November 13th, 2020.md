    - #Philosophy Present understanding:
        - There is no agent or author of my thoughts/feelings/inclinations/actions. These come and go in a constant changing stream governed by their own laws and circumstances.
        - The feeling of authorship arises from thinking. Keep attention on the space between thoughts in order not to reinforce the illusion of authorship.
        - The question of consciousness emergent from the physical universe or the other way round is not answerable. Therefore, there is no reason to speculate in answering it.
