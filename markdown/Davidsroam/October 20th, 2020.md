    - Acquired the book [[On the Path to Enlightenment]] by [[Matthieu Ricard]], based on it being referenced in [[Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body]]. The first pages are built on the conviction of the fact of reincarnation. At least the idea that this human body is a rare opportunity for attaining enlightenment. I see no reason to believe any of that stuff. #Philosophy #Books
    - Went [[bathing]] just before the rain set in. 5 C in the water, 2 C in the air. Immersed for 3:10 minutes. Invigorating.
    - Discussion with [[Peter]], preparing material for the coming steerco. We worked well together, got a lot done in a half hour. #Work

    - I have processed highlights for about 15 books. I have enjoyed both the reading and the processing. I have resonated with many of the propositions which have become #Evergreens, and I have expanded my toolkit for understanding and handling daily life. I have found out about a number of potentially useful practices, without actually implementing them. I have two books which I have recently finished reading for which I have not as yet processed the highlights. There is a long list of books waiting to be read. I need to consider next steps, if I continue as now for some time I will have thousands of #Evergreens but no idea of what to do with them. Not a problem as such, I have enjoyed the process of reading and analysing and will continue with these irrespective of what happens next, but I feel that there is a lot of unused potential.
    - **Thoughts on establishing new practices** [[Practices]]
        - The active practices I have at the moment are: [*](((uZ-P-fLfn)))

            - Intermittent fasting [*](((7XPKOL7kK)))
            - Reading  [*](((U4wFmRA5C)))
                - Including, for non-fiction, highlighting and processing highlights. [*](((UyEr6iG9-)))
        - Possible new practices to cultivate: [*](((RIdMBn-cY)))

                - I have money to invest privately and in Riscom [*](((bN_2HqBFP)))
            - Visualisation techniques such as those described in [[WOOP]] and [[The Tools]] [*](((pguLd19D9)))
            - Creative writing as described in [[Writing Down the Bones]] [*](((xsypMNK3A)))
                - If I were to establish a writing practice, I could potentially have much use of my #Evergreens [*](((M49FjBinm)))
                - A similar practice to [[Writing Down the Bones]] is what [[Jed McKenna]] called "Spiritual Autophagy" [*](((2huQYxNRo)))
            - Implementing the principles described in [[Deep Work]], [[Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day]], [[Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results]] and [[Peak_ Secrets from the New Science of Expertise]]. I feel that I have already done this to some extent. [*](((hnpxaRBUt)))
        - Practices which have previously been important to me and which have become inactive or much less active [*](((kFv78KfPN)))
            - #Photography [*](((d_rS-NBE3)))
                - I don’t feel that I am finished with photography, although I am quite sure that I do not want to do street photography. I don’t feel drawn to landscape photography either. [*](((hOqj97VzY)))
                - I should look at other people’s pictures for a while, and see if I become inspired to choose a direction for the near future.  [*](((ifcz7iRfC)))
                - Taking pictures of family is not going to give me enough practice to develop my skills. [*](((kaTXSJmOH)))
                - I would like to document some group or activity as part of a photography project.  [*](((0cCXdOB78)))
                    - Am I prepared to make the necessary investment in time and effort to do this? [*](((yUK_y4B1N)))
                    - Other alternatives? [*](((t8cueKGGn)))
            - Yoga  [*](((Rx7HLqbD_)))
                - not high prio for me at this stage - PT is enough [*](((fvgX3w5Jr)))
            - Aikido  [*](((_DXt6jn4X)))
                - this was many years ago, I’m not going to go back to it [*](((65IWPzPdo)))
        - New practices take time and effort to establish. I feel I'm doing quite well to regularly do the active practices that I have. I don't want to schedule my days beyond a reasonable level. [*](((MMRBvfTIm)))
