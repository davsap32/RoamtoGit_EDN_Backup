        - Call Esther
-  10:38
    - [[Esther]]'s 90th birthday today. [[Kenneth]] sent out the video greetings he had compiled for her - very nice.
    - Very windy, I am dubious about [[bathing]] today.
    - Announced at #Work yesterday, new unit to be established within CTO with responsibility for service delivery. Manager post to be advertised.
    - ISDM Steerco meeting yesterday - I became impatient at the lack of clarity in decisions as to who would do what and when. Spoke my mind and received some pushback - such is life. #Work
    - Finished reading [[Året med 13 månader]] . enjoyed, well written, personal and honest. Started reading [[On the Plain of Snakes]], seems good. #Books
    - Tried out my [[Pulse Oximeter]] for the first time. Quite simple to use. My % SP O2 is 97. [[Kerstin]] has a reading of 98.
-  15:17
    - Went [[bathing]] - gusty, heavy wind. Waves in the water, not the most pleasant [[bathing]] experience. The first snow of the season fell while I was [[bathing]].
- 17:12
    - The Dlink [[NAS]] was not visible in [[Windows 10]] file explorer on my desktop computer. I fixed this by enabling suppport for the SMB1 file sharing protocol: #[[Home Tech]]

    - Called [[Esther]]to congratulate her on her 90th birthday. She had a good birthday, it seems, with Aviva, [[Ivan]] and [[Rochelle]] for lunch. [[Joe]] overdosed on cake.
