    - I have replaced [[Maggie Appleton]]'s CSS with [[Nat Eliason]]'s. Maggie had styled tags for many attributes that I don't have any use for, so her CSS was unnecessarily complicated.
    - [[Nat Eliason]]'s custom tags:
        - #Inbox
        - #Waiting
        - #Podcast
        - #Goals
        - #Articles
        - #Video
        - #Recipes
        - #Ideas
        - #People
        - #Books
        - #Projects
        - #Tweets
    - Additional custom tags:
        - #Evergreens
        - #Areas
    - Other status tags used by [[Nat Eliason]]  which I will use:
        - #Active
        - #Archived
        - #Completed
- 12:21
    - Planned meeting in Stockholm tomorrow will be by Video instead, so I won't travel to Stockholm tomorrow.
    - I have made some progress with restructuring #Areas, #Projects and todos. I have updated the mindmap as I did this (file at C:\Users\davsa\Dropbox\edraw mindmaster\todo attributes.emmx):

    -  UK meeting on JIRA postponed. 
    - Went #bathing . Sunny - pleasant. [[Kerstin]] came with. 16 C in the air and 15 C in the water.
    - It was useful to draw my database structure as a [[Mindmap]]. I had some trouble activating [[Mindmaster]] which is the app I use for this purpose. I chatted with Edraw Support, who helped me. It turns out that I need to log in to the app for it to be activated. If I open a file before logging in then I have to close it and reopen it after logging in.
    - [[Marianne]] has asked [[Valy]] to help her with her roof tile which needs replacing. I think he may go there this evening.
    - I have continued to follow [[Nat Eliason]]'s course [[Effortless output with Roam]], finding it very useful. I have copied his [[CSS theme]] as well as his [[Templates]]. I am looking forward to watching the lessons on synthesis.
    - 16:21
        - Watching the #Inbox lesson of [[Effortless output with Roam]]. [[Nat Eliason]] uses the #Inbox tag in much the same way as I us #Inbox. 
            - {{{[[DONE]]}}}} consider consolidating these two tags. #[[Digital Garden]]

    - While washing dishes, I listened to the [[Mark and Carrie]] #Podcast of 20200821. The main theme of the podcast is that the main part of corporations income is from assets - with customers subscribing to existing services. There is very little incentive to innovate. Apple is at present valued to about 10% of the US economy, corresponding to a market expectation of future profits from Appleâ€™s subscription services. Customers have little use for new functions in their telephones. #Podcast #Inbox

    - Started reading [[The Socrates Express]] - not worth reading. It tries to be entertaining by being superficial. Not for me. The only useful part of the book is the bibliography. In it, I find the book [[The Heart of Philosophy]] by [[Jacob Needleman]]. I would much like to read a general introduction to philosophy, probably this book would be a good one.  #Books
