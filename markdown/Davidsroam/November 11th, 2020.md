    - Just got back from picnic lunch with [[Carl-Otto]] and [[Cecilia]].They had prepared pizza and other food which we ate by a campfire in the forest. Pleasant.

    - Difficult times at #Work. We are not delvering service agreement updates to UK as expected, these questions are not being prioritised by line managers at group level. I have argued for the need for an extra exec meeting to set priorities between UK and CT.
    - Skipped breathwork, meditation and [[bathing]] today, due to several work meetings and lunch in the forest. Feel somewhat drained after all of this.

    - Now I have: [[Lightroom Cleanup]]
        - rated and edited the pictures from our long journey (20171229-20180313)
        - converted them to DNG
        - deleted unrated pictures
        - backed up the pictures as a [[Lightroom]] catalog
        - Uploaded to [[SmugMug]]
        - Remains to get an idea of how many [[Lightroom]] folders need to be processed in this way.
