    - Preparing for lunch with [[Amanda]] and [[Lukas]]

    - Amanda and Lukas were here for lunch, he seems pleasant, mature and quite sure of himself. Hard to get to know someone in a short time. They went into the forest after lunch to pick berries and have just c.me home.
    - I have been leafing through the book [[Conscious [[Creativity]]]] by [[Philippa Stanton]].  She proposes exercises for seeing in order to be able to recognize images worth photographing.

From [[Conscious creativity]] by [[Philippa Stanton]].  
        - ^^ABSTRACT SPOTTING is a practice of noticing the form of shapes out of context and a simple viewfinder or mobile camera is incredibly helpful for framing abstract shapes. 2. MATCHING is a practice of looking out for objects, forms or shapes that visually match others closely, but are functionally completely different. 3. SYMMETRY AND PATTERN SPOTTING is a practice of consciously noticing and actively looking for pattern connections, no matter how random or abstract. You will become more adept at spotting patterns the more practised you become. ^^
        - ^^Itâ€™s really important to keep practising observing shape similarities and colour connections. Seeing shapes and colours without the burden of thinking about what they are will liberate your creative mind, inform your visual resources and alleviate intellectual interference. ^^
