- 19:27
    - Finished reading [[The Zen Master's Dance]]. Need to process highlights. #Books #Philosophy
    - Read [[Wim Hof Method : Activate Your Full Human Potential]] by [[Wim Hof]]. Skimmed most of it. Lots of hyperbole. Found nothing worth highlighting. #Health #Books
    - Continued reading [[Stormbird]], I feel lukewarm about this book. It's an adventure book with some basis in history, I'm in the balance as to whether to abandon it. #Books
    - Mowed the lawn and vacuumed the bedroom floor, I will vacuum the rest of the house tomorrow. #[[Sort and Tidy]]
    - While vacuuming and mowing, listened to a program in the Spectator TV series about the American election. The subject of the American election is an infinity pool of its own. 
    - Listened also to a talk by [[Ajahn Sona]] titled "Twenty years a monk", which I enjoyed. The insight which eventually led to him becoming a monk was that the person you think you are is just a story. #Philosophy

    - Started reading [[The Stoic Guide to a Happy Life]] #Philosophy
