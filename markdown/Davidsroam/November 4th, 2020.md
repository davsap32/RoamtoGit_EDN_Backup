    - Lay awake part of last night - perhaps because of the ongoing election in USA. Results undecisive at this stage. Trump has called for a halt to counting. Will there be violence.
    - Read more of [[Who They Was]] yesterday evening - a very good novel (or autobiography?).

    - I fetched [[Leo]] and [[Alice]], they came home and had dinner with us. [[Josefine]] and [[Ellen]] arrived a bit later and ate here as well. 
    - Things seem to be going OK for [[Samuel]] in [[Cape Town]], although customs are messing him around with his computers.
