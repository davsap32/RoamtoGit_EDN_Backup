    - Body Oxygen Level Test (BOLT) Your progress can be determined by a reduction to breathlessness during physical exercise, how you feel, and your BOLT score as follows: 1.   Take a small, silent breath in through your nose, and allow a small, silent breath out through your nose. 2.   Hold your nose with your fingers to prevent air from entering your lungs. 3.   Count the number of seconds until you feel the first definite desire to breathe. 4.   At the first definite desire to breathe in, you may also feel the first involuntary movements of your breathing muscles. (Your abdomen may jerk and the area around your neck may contract.) 5.   Release your nose and breathe in through it. 6.   Your inhalation at the end of the breath should be calm. Your BOLT score is the length of time in seconds that you are able to hold your breath until you feel the first physical signals to take a breath. To increase your BOLT score, it is necessary to: •  Nose-breathe at all times, including during physical exercise and sleep. •  Avoid taking large breaths while sighing, yawning, and talking. •  Practice Oxygen Advantage exercises appropriate to your health and fitness. By incorporating the Oxygen Advantage exercises into your routine, your BOLT score should increase by 3 to 4 seconds during the first week. After continued practice for a number of weeks, you may find your BOLT score remains stubbornly at about 20 seconds. Continue to practice and incorporate breath holds into your physical exercise to increase your BOLT score above 20 seconds. It can take 6 months for an individual to reach a BOLT score of 40 seconds, but by then your health and fitness levels will be at a totally different place than before. Enjoy the journey!

    - Nose Unblocking Exercise (Please do not practice this exercise if your BOLT score is less than 10 seconds, or if you are pregnant or have high blood pressure, cardiovascular issues, diabetes, or any serious health concerns.) To unblock the nose, perform the following: 1.   Take a small, silent breath in and a small, silent breath out through your nose. 2.   Pinch your nose with your fingers to hold your breath. 3.   Walk as many paces as possible with your breath held. Try to build up a strong air shortage, without overdoing it, of course! 4.   When you resume breathing, do so only through your nose; your breathing must be calmed immediately. 5.   After resuming your breathing, your first breath will usually be bigger than normal. Make sure that you calm your breathing as soon as possible by suppressing your second and third breaths. 6.   You should be able to recover your breath within 2 to 3 breaths. If you cannot, you have held your breath for too long. 7.   Wait for about a minute or so and then repeat. 8.   Repeat this exercise 5 or 6 times until the nose is decongested.

    - Breathe Light to Breathe Right 1.   Place one hand on your chest and the other just above your navel to help you to follow your breathing. 2.   Breathe in and gently guide your abdomen outward. 3.   Breathe out and gently guide your abdomen inward. 4.   Observe your breathing pattern, noting the size and depth of each breath. 5.   Apply gentle pressure with your hands to slightly reduce your breathing movements. It should feel as if you are breathing against your hands. 6.   Encourage the depth of each breath to reduce. 7.   Take in a smaller or shorter breath than you would like. 8.   Allow a relaxed breath out, exhaling gently, slowly, and easily. 9.   Bring a feeling of relaxation to your breathing. 10. Do not tense your body, hold your breath, or pause your breathing. Continue to breathe smoothly but take in less air than before. 11. The objective of this exercise is to create a tolerable hunger for air. Try to sustain this for 3 to 5 minutes at a time. If your breathing rhythm becomes chaotic or if your breathing muscles contract, then the air shortage you have created is too much. If these signs occur, stop the exercise and return to it when breathing is back to normal.

    - Breathe Light to Breathe Right—Jogging, Running, or Any Other Activity No matter what type of exercise you prefer, make sure that you observe your breath and become aware of your inner body. Bring your entire attention from your mind into your body. Move with every cell of your body, from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. Allow your body to find its perfect work rate by breathing through your nose in a steady and regular fashion. Continue to increase your pace to the point where you can maintain steady and regular nasal breathing. If your breathing rhythm becomes chaotic and it is necessary to open your mouth to breathe, you will know that the intensity is too much. If necessary, slow your pace to a walk for 2 to 3 minutes before resuming your jog. As you run, feel each gentle connection between your feet and the ground as you propel yourself forward. Avoid pounding the pavement as this will lead to sore hips and joints and other possible injuries. Instead, bring a feeling of lightness to your body and visualize yourself barely touching the ground as your run. Imagine yourself running over thin twigs, treading so softly that they do not break. The mantra to follow is: light foot strikes, a relaxed body, and regular, steady breathing. If you keep your mouth closed throughout your exercise, your breathing will recover quickly.

    - Breathing Recovery, Improved Concentration To recover from physical exercise and to help calm your breathing or mind, practice the following exercise for 3 to 5 minutes: 1.   Exhale as normal through the nose. 2.   Pinch your nose with your fingers to hold the breath for 2 to 5 seconds. 3.   Breathe normally through the nose for 10 seconds. 4.   Repeat the first three steps.

    - Simulate High-Altitude Training—Walking If you have a pulse oximeter, you might find it motivating to observe the decrease to your oxygen saturation as you do this. Continue walking throughout the exercise and hold your breath only until you feel a medium hunger for air for the first 2 to 3 breath holds. For the remaining breath holds, it is beneficial to hold the breath until you feel a relatively strong hunger for air. 1.   Walk for 1 minute or so while breathing through your nose. 2.   Gently exhale and hold your breath, followed by minimal breathing for 15 seconds: Gently exhale, pinch your nose, and walk while holding the breath until you feel a medium hunger for air, then release your nose, inhale through it, and minimize your breathing for 15 seconds by taking short breaths. After 30 seconds of continued walking and nose breathing, repeat the breath hold until you feel a medium hunger for air. Minimize your breathing for 15 seconds, then allow your breathing to return to normal and through the nose. 3.   Continue walking for 30 seconds and repeat: Continue walking for around 30 seconds while breathing through your nose, then gently exhale and pinch your nose with your fingers. Walk while holding your breath until you feel a medium to strong hunger for air. Release your nose and minimize your breathing by taking short breaths for about 15 seconds. Then resume breathing through your nose. 4.   Repeat breath holds 8 to 10 times: While continuing to walk, perform a breath hold every minute or so in order to create a medium to strong need for air. Minimize your breathing for 15 seconds following each breath hold. Repeat for a total of 8 to 10 breath holds during your walk. A typical increase in the number of paces per breath hold might look like this: 20, 20, 30, 35, 42, 47, 53, 60, 60, 55.

    - Breath Holding During Running Breath holding can also be incorporated into more intense exercise, such as running: 1.   10 to 15 minutes into your run, gently exhale and hold your breath until a strong air shortage is reached. The length of the breath hold may range from 10 to 40 paces and will depend on your running speed and BOLT score. 2.   Following the breath hold, continue to jog with nose breathing for about 1 minute, until your breathing has partially recovered. 3.   Repeat the breath hold 8 to 10 times for the duration of your run. The breath hold should be a challenge and, at the same time, should allow breathing to recover to normal within a couple of breaths.

    - Breathe Light to Breathe Right (Advanced Method) The advanced version of Breathe Light to Breathe Right is best practiced after you have mastered the basic exercise as described on page 74. The following will teach you how to combine reduced breathing with abdominal breathing to increase your BOLT score. Please note that just like any form of physical exercise, it is easier and more beneficial if you practice reduced breathing exercises at least an hour or more after eating a meal. This exercise involves three simple stages: 1.   Activating and strengthening the diaphragm 2.   Merging your breathing with the movements of your abdomen 3.   Reducing your breathing to create an air shortage By practicing abdominal breathing, you will allow it to become your natural breathing method. This exercise is split into three parts to ensure that you learn the technique correctly and to gradually incorporate abdominal breathing into your normal breathing habits. First you must learn to relax the diaphragm muscle so that it can be activated during breathing. Second, you must learn to match the movements of the abdomen with the breath to engage the diaphragm. And finally, you will be able to practice breathing lightly with abdominal breathing to maximize body oxygenation during rest. Remember that to improve your breathing during exercise, you must first learn how to breathe efficiently at rest. Stage 1: Relaxing and Activating the Diaphragm •  Sit up straight but do not force yourself into a rigid upright position, as doing so will only increase the tension in your body. Instead, try to lengthen the distance between your navel and sternum (chest); imagine a piece of string gently lifting you up from the top of the back of your head. •  As you guide your body upward, imagine the space between your ribs becoming wider. •  Place one hand on your chest and one hand just above your navel. At this point, do not concern yourself with how you are breathing. •  Bring your attention to the movements of your lower hand. While sitting up straight, gently guide your hand outward by pushing your abdomen outward, just enough to feel the movement. There is no need to make any changes to your breathing at this point—this stage is primarily to encourage abdominal movement. •  Now draw in your abdomen and watch your hand move gently inward. •  Perform this simple exercise for a few minutes to help activate a “stiff” diaphragm. •  Alternatively, you could perform this exercise while lying on your back with both knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Stage 1 in Brief •  Gently push your abdomen out. Watch your hand move outward. •  Gently draw your abdomen in. Watch your hand move inward. If your diaphragm is particularly stiff due to years of breathing with the upper chest, the following additional exercise will help to activate the muscle and encourage better breathing: •  Take a gentle breath in through your nose. •  Allow a gentle breath out through your nose. •  Hold your nose with your fingers and close your mouth to prevent air from flowing. •  Now try to breathe in and out, while at the same time holding your breath. •  As you try to breathe in and out, you may feel your stomach move in and out as your breathing muscles contract to help relax the diaphragm. •  When you feel a medium desire to breathe, let go of your nose and resume breathing normally through your nose. •  Practice this exercise 2 or 3 times to help to relax the diaphragm. When you feel you can move your abdomen in and out easily at will, proceed to Stage 2, which incorporates these abdomen movements with your breathing. Stage 2: Merging Abdominal Movements with Breathing •  Sit up straight. •  Place one hand on your chest and the other hand on your abdomen. •  As you breathe, allow your shoulders to relax into their natural position. •  Gently encourage chest movements to reduce as you breathe, using the guidance of your mind and your hand. •  At the same time, try to coordinate your abdomen movements with your breathing. •  As you breathe in, gently guide your abdomen outward. Imagine you are breathing into your tummy. (Try not to make the movement too big, as doing so may cause dizziness.) •  As you breathe out, gently draw your abdomen in. •  Your breathing should be gentle, silent, and calm. •  Perform this exercise for a few minutes to acclimatize yourself to the movements of your diaphragm and your breath. If you are finding this exercise difficult, you may find it easier to activate abdominal breathing while lying on your back in a semi-supine position. Try the following exercise lying on a mat with a small pillow under your head and your knees bent, as shown on the following page. •  Place a relatively large book on the area just above your navel. •  As you breathe in, bring your breathing into your abdomen by gently guiding your abdomen to move the book upward. •  As you breathe out, gently allow the abdomen to move back to its original position. •  The inhalation is the active phase, and the exhalation is passive, as you allow the air to leave the body naturally and effortlessly. While breathing in, imagine inflating your tummy with a light amount of air and watch the book rise. While breathing out, imagine a balloon slowly deflating of its own accord. Stage 2 in Brief •  Breathe in. Gently guide your abdomen out. •  Breathe out. Gently draw your abdomen in. When you are confident that you are able to match your breathing with the movements of your diaphragm, proceed to Stage 3. Stage 3: Reducing Breathing Volume Using Abdominal Breathing If you have tried Stages 1 and 2 but still find you are unable to switch from upper-chest to abdominal breathing, don’t be concerned—it can take time to readjust to a new way of breathing after years of breathing from the upper chest. You can still proceed to Stage 3—simply keep practicing all three stages until it becomes easier. The more you use these exercises, the greater your tolerance of carbon dioxide will become. Reducing your breathing is about lowering the amount of air you take into your lungs during each minute. As you reduce your breathing, there will be a slight accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood, assisting with the relaxation of the diaphragm. If you have already mastered diaphragmatic breathing through the first two stages, then you will find that it is a lot easier to reduce your breathing volume toward normal as you practice Stage 3. There are two main approaches to reducing breathing volume using diaphragmatic breathing. The first is to bring a feeling of relaxation to the body, to gently allow your breathing movements to slow down and become softer. As your body relaxes, your breathing will automatically reduce in response. The second approach is to tune in to your breathing pattern, noting the size of each inhalation and exhalation. By concentrating on the rhythm of your breathing for a minute or two, you will gain a sense of how much air you are taking into your body. As you follow your breathing, gently encourage it to slow down so that your breathing movements gradually reduce to the point where you feel a subtle need for air. This urge to breathe is the core of reduced breathing exercises and is a sign that you are actively altering your breathing habits toward a healthier, more effective level. When you first attempt reduced breathing exercises, you may find the sensation of air shortage difficult to maintain, but it is essential to keep practicing if you want to bring about changes to your body and improve your sporting performance. The following sentence is the most important point of this entire book, and something I explain to my students daily: The only way to know you are reducing your breathing volume is feeling as if you would like to take in a bigger breath. The need to take a bigger breath is similar to the feeling you will have experienced during your measurement of BOLT. This urge for air should not be stressful, but should be similar to what you might experience during a normal walk. In Stage 3, we will bring abdominal breathing and reduced breathing together. To practice this exercise, it can be ve
