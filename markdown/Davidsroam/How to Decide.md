    - #[[E: Resulting is a mental shortcut in which we use the quality of an outcome to figure out the quality of a decision]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Sometimes we make good decisions and they turn out well. Sometimes we make good decisions and they turn out poorly. 
        - A necessary part of becoming a better decision-maker is learning from experience. Experience contains the lessons for improving future decisions. Resulting causes you to learn the wrong lessons. 
        - There are more possible futures than the one that actually happens. 
        - Resulting is the tendency to look at whether a result was good or bad to figure out whether a decision was good or bad. Outcomes cast a shadow over the decision process, leading you to overlook or distort information about the process, making your view of decision quality fit with outcome quality. In the short-term, for any single decision, there is only a loose relationship between the quality of the decision and the quality of the outcome. The two are correlated, but the relationship can take a long time to play out. Luck is what intervenes between your decision and the actual outcome. Resulting diminishes your view of the role of luck. You can’t tell that much about the quality of a decision from a single outcome, because of luck. When you make a decision, you can rarely guarantee a good outcome (or a bad one). Instead, the goal is to try to choose the option that will lead to the most favorable range of outcomes. Making better decisions starts with learning from experience. Resulting interferes with that learning, causing you to repeat some low-quality decisions and stop making some high-quality decisions. It also keeps you from examining good-quality/good-outcome decisions (as well as bad-quality/bad-outcome decisions), which still offer valuable lessons for future decisions. Resulting reduces compassion when it comes to how we treat others and ourselves. 
        - Resulting makes you think that you know something about whether a decision was good or bad because you know if the outcome is good or bad. Hindsight bias adds to the ruckus caused by knowing the outcome, distorting your memory of what you knew at the time of the decision in two ways: You did know what was going to happen—swapping out your actual view at the time of the decision with a faulty memory of that view to conform to your postoutcome knowledge. You should (or could) have known what was going to happen—to the point of predictability or inevitability. 
    - #[[E: Experience is supposed to be our best teacher, but sometimes we draw a connection between outcome quality and decision quality that is too tight]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Doing so distorts our ability to use those experiences to figure out which decisions were good and which were bad. Resulting makes our crystal ball cloudy. 
    - #[[E: Making a decision limits the possible outcomes but does not determine which of the outcomes will actually occur]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - For any single decision, there are different ways the future could unfold—some better, some worse. When you make a decision, the decision makes certain paths possible (even if you don’t know where they lead) and others impossible. The decision you make determines which set of outcomes are possible and how likely each of those outcomes is. But it doesn’t determine which of that set of outcomes will actually happen. 
    - #[[E: Luck exerts its influence between your decision and which of the possible paths you end up on]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - It is the element you have no control over that determines which of the possible outcomes you actually observe in the short run. 
    - #[[E: Being a better decision-maker means being a better predictor of the set of possible futures]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
    - #[[E: A good decision with a good outcome is an Earned Reward. A bad decision with a good outcome is Dumb Luck]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - An Earned Reward comes when you make a good-quality decision that results in a good outcome, like when you proceed through a green light and get through the intersection safely. Dumb Luck comes when you make a poor-quality decision that turns out well. You can be waiting at a traffic light and fail to notice the light has turned green because you are deeply entranced by the world’s most important tweet. If, while you are sitting there failing to proceed through the intersection, you happen to avoid getting in an accident with a car whose driver ignores the red light in their direction and barrels through the intersection, that doesn’t make looking at Twitter while driving a good decision. That’s just Dumb Luck. 
    - #[[E: A good decision which turns out poorly is Bad Luck. A bad decision which turns out poorly is Just Deserts]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Bad Luck comes when you make a good-quality decision that turns out poorly. You can proceed through a green light and get in an accident with someone turning into traffic. That’s a bad outcome, but it wasn’t because your decision to follow the traffic laws was poor. Just Deserts means making a poor-quality decision that results in a bad outcome, like running a red light and getting in an accident. 
    - #[[E: Left to our own devices, we will notice some of the bad luck but overlook most of the dumb luck]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
    - #[[E: It’s not easy to be willing to give up the credit that comes from feeling like you made good things happen, but it is worth it in the long run]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Small changes in how much you notice the luck that you would otherwise overlook will have a big influence on the way your life turns out. Those small changes act like compounding interest that pays big dividends on your future decision-making. 
    - #[[E: Experience can teach you a lot about how to improve your decision-making, but only if you listen well]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Developing the discipline to separate the quality of the result from the quality of the decision can help you to figure out which decisions are worth repeating and which aren’t. 
        - Learning from experience is what allows you to make better decisions as you go along. Resulting keeps you from sharpening the view into your crystal ball, making you a worse predictor of the future because you skip lessons you could get from the past. An insidious cost of resulting is that you don’t question your assessment when decision quality and outcome quality align. When that happens, especially when things worked out, your decisions are more likely to remain unexamined while you just accept your intuition, which tells you, “Nothing to see here.” 
    - #[[E: Memory creep is the reconstruction of your memory of what you knew that hindsight bias creates]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - When what you know after the fact creeps into your memory of what you knew before the fact. 
    - #[[E: Writing down the key facts informing your decision acts like a vaccine against hindsight bias]]   #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Detailing what you knew and when you knew it helps prevent stuff that revealed itself after the fact from reflexively creeping into the before-the-fact box. 
        - It can be hard to accurately recall what you knew before the fact once you already know the outcome. Journaling gives you something concrete to refer back to. Thinking about what you know at the time of the decision in this more deliberative way creates a clearer time stamp, preventing memory creep before it happens. 
    - #[[E: Hindsight bias, like resulting, makes us lack compassion for ourselves and others]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - In order to think about what was reasonable for someone to know, we have to have empathy for them. We don’t generally take the time to do this, and instead make snap judgments. We are quick to blame the decision-maker for a bad outcome, neglecting to put ourselves in their shoes at the time of the decision (e.g., “You made us late to the airport with your stupid shortcut. How could you not have known there would be such bad traffic?”). That’s true even when we’re the decision-maker and we’re in our own shoes. This lack of empathy isn’t limited to bad outcomes. Hindsight bias makes us unduly punish ourselves and others for being careful or agonizing over a decision that works out well (e.g., “Why did I waste so much time worrying about the weather?”). 
    - #[[E: Hindsight bias is the tendency to believe that an outcome, after it occurs, was predictable or inevitable]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Hindsight bias, like resulting, is a manifestation of the outsized influence of outcomes. In this case, the outcome casts a shadow over your ability to accurately remember what you knew at the time of the decision. Hindsight bias distorts the way you process outcomes in two ways: Should have known and Knew it all along. Hindsight bias is frequently connected with a set of verbal or mental cues. (See the exercises in sections (2) and (4) for examples you’ve identified, as well as the checklist to follow.) Once you know how a decision turns out, you can experience memory creep, where the stuff that reveals itself after the fact creeps into your memory of what you knew or was knowable before the decision. To learn from your choices and their outcomes, you need to strive to be accurate about what you knew at the time of your decision. The Knowledge Tracker is a tool that can help separate what you knew from what you subsequently learned. Hindsight bias leads us to lack compassion for ourselves and others. 
    - #[[E: Experience is necessary for learning, but individual experiences often interfere with learning]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - This is partly because of the biases that cause us to overfit outcomes and decision quality. Viewing the outcome that occurred in the context of other potential outcomes at the time of the decision can help to resolve this paradox. There are many possible futures but only one past. Because of this, the past feels inevitable. Re-creating a simplified version of a decision tree puts the actual outcome in its proper context. Exploring the other possible outcomes is a form of counterfactual thinking. A counterfactual is something that relates to an outcome that has not happened but could have happened, or an imagined state of the world. Our willingness to examine outcomes is asymmetrical. We are more eager to put bad outcomes in context than good ones. Becoming a better decision-maker requires us to try (difficult though it may be) to put those good outcomes in perspective. 
        - That individual outcomes play an outsized role provides a clue as to how to resolve the paradox. We need to shrink outcomes down, closer to their appropriate size. A good first step in accomplishing that is to put an individual outcome in the context of all the other outcomes that could have occurred. Your timeline, your reality, consists of the decisions you’ve made and their outcomes. Your experience is constructed only of the things that have actually happened. If you could glimpse the other timelines that might have materialized if things had turned out differently, you would take a giant first step toward improving your ability to figure out when (and what) to learn from outcomes. 
    - #[[E: You can’t fully understand what there is to learn from any outcome without understanding the other things that could have happened]].   #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
    - #[[E: There’s an asymmetry in our willingness to put outcomes in context: We’d rather do it when we fail than when we succeed]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
    - #[[E: When evaluating whether the outcome provides a lesson about decision quality, create a decision tree]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Identify the decision. 
        - Identify the actual outcome. 
        - Along with the actual outcome, create a tree with other reasonable outcomes that were possible at the time of the decision. 
        - Explore the other possible outcomes to understand better what is to be learned from the actual outcome you got. 
        - Example:
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FDavidsroam%2FrNyh-c63Ge.jpg?alt=media&token=6e1b4afa-112e-4a59-8359-fcda5f1a96c8)
    - #[[E: Decision making is a six step process]] #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Identify the reasonable set of possible outcomes. 
        - Identify your preference using the payoff for each outcome—to what degree do you like or dislike each outcome, given your values? 
        - Estimate the likelihood of each outcome unfolding. 
        - Assess the relative likelihood of outcomes you like and dislike for the option under consideration. 
        - Repeat Steps 1–4 for other options under consideration. 
        - Compare the options to one another. 
    - #[[E: Advice can be an excellent decision tool as long as you are explicit about your goals and values when you are seeking that advice]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Otherwise, you run the risk that the person whose advice you are seeking will assume you share their preferences and will answer accordingly. 
    - #[[E: Create a tree of outcomes, marking those you like and those you do not like]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - For any decision you make, there are some outcomes you hope for and some you don’t. By explicitly adding preferences to the tree, you can see at a glance how many of the possible outcomes you like and how many you don’t. That’s why it’s helpful to order the possibilities by preference. Of course, just because a decision has mostly good or mostly bad outcomes isn’t enough to determine whether the decision is, correspondingly, good or bad. You also need to know the magnitude of each outcome—how good or how bad. In other words, you need to think about the size of your preference—the degree to which you like or dislike each of the possibilities. 
        - Incorporating preferences, payoffs, and probabilities into a decision tree is an integral part of a good decision process. Preference is individual to you, dependent on your goals and values. The payoff is how an outcome affects your progress toward or away from a goal. Some possibilities will have payoffs where you gain something you value. These comprise the upside potential of a decision. Some possibilities will have payoffs where you lose something you value. These comprise the downside potential of a decision. Risk is your exposure to the downside. Payoffs can be measured in anything you value (money, time, happiness, health, the happiness or health or wealth of others, social currency, etc.). When you’re figuring out whether a decision is good or bad, you’re comparing the upside to the downside. Does the upside potential compensate for the risk of the downside potential? Probabilities express how likely something is to occur. Combining probabilities with preferences and payoffs helps you to better resolve the paradox of experience, allowing you to get out from under the shadow of the particular result that you are dealt. Combining probabilities with preferences and payoffs helps you more clearly evaluate and compare options. A pros and cons list is flat. It lacks information about both the size of the payoffs and the probability of any pro or con occurring. Because of that, it is a low-quality decision tool for evaluating options and comparing them to one another. Most people are reluctant to estimate the likelihood of something happening in the future. (“That’s speculative.” “I don’t know enough.” “I’d just be guessing.”) Even though your information is usually imperfect, you know something about most things, enough to make an educated guess. The willingness to guess is essential to improving decisions. If you don’t make yourself guess, you’ll be less likely to ask “What do I know?” and “What don’t I know?” You can start expressing probabilities by using common terms. That gets you thinking about how often outcomes will occur, presents a view of relative likelihood, and gives you a snapshot of the overall likelihood of the best and worst outcomes. 
    - #[[E: If an outcome moves you toward a goal, the payoff is positive. If an outcome moves you away from a goal, the payoff is negative]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - For almost any set of outcomes, there will be stuff you could gain and stuff you could lose. These gains or losses are called payoffs and they will drive your preferences because, obviously, you will prefer gains over losses. If an outcome moves you toward a goal, the payoff is positive. If an outcome moves you away from a goal, the payoff is negative. The magnitude of that move drives how much you prefer or dislike an outcome. The bigger the gain, the bigger the preference for that result. The bigger the loss, the bigger the dislike for that result. The most straightforward way to understand payoffs is for decisions where the quality of the outcome is measured in money. If you make an investment that earns you money, that’s a gain. If you lose money, well, that’s a loss. But payoffs can also be in the currency of anything you value, such as happiness (your own or that of others), time, social currency, self-improvement, self-esteem, goodwill, and health, etc.

    - #[[E: Assessing the quality of a decision involves figuring out whether going for the upside is worth risking the downside]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
    - #[[E: In order to make a good decision, you need to know both the outcomes and their likelihoods]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - To figure out whether a decision is good or bad, you need to know not just the things that might reasonably happen and what could be gained or lost, but also the likelihood of each possibility unfolding. That means, to become a better decision-maker, you need to be willing to estimate those probabilities. 
        - Assess the relative likelihood of outcomes you like and dislike for the option under consideration. 
        - BASE RATE How likely something is to happen in situations similar to the one you’re considering. 
    - #[[E: Good decision-making requires a willingness to guess]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Don’t overlook the territory in between right and wrong. Don’t overlook the value in being a little less wrong or a little closer to right. 
        - All guesses are educated guesses because there is almost no estimate you could make about which you literally know nothing. 
        - Making a decision is making a guess about how things might turn out. 
    - #[[E: Think about how to make your guess more educated]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - your job as a decision-maker is to figure out two things: 
            - What do I already know that will make my guess more educated? 
            - What can I find out that will make my guess more educated? 
        - Your chief weapon to improve your decisions is turning some of the “stuff you don’t know” into “stuff you know.” 
    - #[[E: There are two ways uncertainty intervenes in the decision process: imperfect information and luck]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Imperfect information intervenes before the decision. Luck intervenes after the decision but before the outcome. 
    - #[[E: The further you are from perfect information, the larger the target you’re defining]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - The closer you are to having perfect information, the smaller the target you’re defining. On the rare occasions when you have perfect information and no uncertainty, your target will be all bull’s-eye. 
        - The goal is to set the narrowest range you can, where you would still be pretty shocked if the bull’s-eye wasn’t in the range. 
    - #[[E: In general, we don’t question our own beliefs enough]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - We have too much confidence in what we think we know and we don’t have a realistic view of what we don’t know. Whether it’s about the things we believe to be true, our opinions, or how we think the future might unfold, we could all use a healthy dose of skepticism. Making it a habit to ask yourself, “If I were wrong, why would that be?” helps get you to approach your own beliefs with more skepticism, disciplining your naturally overly optimistic view of what you know and getting you more focused on what you don’t know. Asking yourself why you might be wrong will also increase the accuracy of the things you believe, the opinions you hold, and how you think the future might unfold. That’s because when you ask yourself what information you could discover that would make you change your mind, you can actually go find out some of that stuff. And in asking and answering the question, you are just more likely to go look for it. Even when the information that would change your mind isn’t readily available, it might be available in the future. Doing the advance work of thinking about the things that might change your mind increases the chances that you’ll both be on the lookout for that corrective information in the future and that you’ll be open-minded to it when you come across it. 
    - #[[E: Your goal should be to have approximately 90% of your estimates capture the objectively true value]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Natural language terms that express likelihoods, like “very likely” and “unlikely,” are useful but blunt instruments. The drive to improve on your initial estimates is what motivates you to check your information and learn more. If you hide behind the safety of a general term, there’s no reason to improve on it or calibrate. Terms that express likelihoods mean very different things to different people. Using ambiguous terms can lead to confusion and miscommunication with people you want to engage for help. Being more precise, by expressing probabilities as percentages, makes it more likely you’ll uncover information that can correct inaccuracies in your beliefs and broaden your knowledge. You can use your answers to the Mauboussins’ survey to help you convert natural language terms to exact probabilities. In addition to making precise (bull’s-eye) estimates, offer a range around that estimate to express your uncertainty. Do this by including a lower and upper bound that communicate the size of your target. The size of the range signals what you know and what you don’t know. The larger the range, the less information or the lower the quality of the information informing your estimate, and the more you need to learn. Communicating the size of the range also signals to others that you need their knowledge and perspective to narrow the range. Use the shock test to determine if your upper and lower bounds are reasonable: Would you be really shocked if the correct answer was outside that boundary? Your goal should be to have approximately 90% of your estimates capture the objectively true value. Develop a habit of asking yourself, “What information could I find out that would tell me that my estimate or my belief is wrong?” 
    - #[[E: The luck in the way the future happens to unfold for you plays an outsized role]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - It matters little how objectively likely or unlikely an outcome is. What matters most is that you happen to have experienced it. Here are some other commonly known cognitive biases that are also, in part, inside view problems: 
            - Confirmation bias—Our tendency to notice, interpret, and seek out information that confirms or strengthens our existing beliefs. 
            - Disconfirmation bias—Confirmation bias’s sibling. Our tendency to apply a higher, more critical standard to information that contradicts our beliefs than to information that confirms them. 
            - Overconfidence—Overestimating our skills, intellect, or talent, interfering with our ability to make decisions depending on such estimates. 
            - Availability bias—The tendency to overestimate the frequency of events that are easy to recall because they are vivid or because we’ve experienced them a lot. 
            - Recency bias—Believing that recent events are more likely to occur than they actually are. 
            - Illusion of control—Overestimating our ability to control events. In other words, to underestimate the influence of luck. 
    - #[[E: When we approach a decision, we have already started to form an opinion about what the right option is]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Usually we don’t even know we have already formed an opinion, but that opinion can, nonetheless, end up in the driver’s seat, directing our decision process. This exposes the biggest issue with a pros and cons list: Like your intuition and gut, it also serves at the pleasure of the inside view, getting you to the decision you want to make rather than the decision that is objectively better. Want to reject an option? You’ll focus on the con side of the list, expanding that side of the comparision. Want to move forward with an option? You’ll focus and expand on the pro side of the list as the cons hide in the shadows. A pros and cons list is generated entirely from your perspective, absent the outside view, easily infected by reasoning in a way that is motivated to support a conclusion you want to get to. In fact, if you wanted to create a decision tool to amplify bias, it would look like a pros and cons list. 
    - #[[E: Accuracy lives in the intersection of the outside view and the inside view]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - INSIDE VIEW The view of the world from inside of your own perspective, your own experiences, and your own beliefs. 
        - OUTSIDE VIEW What is true of the world, independent of your own perspective. The way that others would view the situation you’re in. 
        - Another way to the outside view: Actively find out what other people know 
        - The person you’re most likely to mislead is yourself. And you don’t know you’re doing it, because you’re living in the inside view. 
        - Just asking for advice or feedback isn’t enough to ensure that you get the outside view, because people are mostly reluctant to disagree for fear of being unkind, for fear of embarrassing you by challenging your beliefs, or for fear of offering a perspective that might cast you in an unflattering light. Worse, we all like to hear the inside view repeated back to us and we seek out people we suspect view the world the same way we do. That’s why we naturally end up in echo chambers. The inside view feels especially good when it’s sold as the outside view, in the guise of someone supposedly offering an objective perspective that merely confirms what you believe. But that only serves to amplify the inside view, strengthening your view of the world because it feels certified by others. 
        - The inside view is the view of the world through your own perspective, your own beliefs, and your own experiences. Many common cognitive biases are, in part, the product of the inside view. Pros and cons lists amplify the inside view. The outside view is the way that others would see your situation, or what’s true of the world in general, independent of your own perspective. It’s important to explore the outside view even if you think you’ve got your facts straight, because it’s possible other people could look at the same facts and come to different conclusions. The outside view acts to discipline the biases and inaccuracies that live in the inside view, which is why you want to anchor first to the outside view. Accuracy lives at the intersection between the inside view and the outside view. The things that are particular to your situation matter, but those particulars should be married with the things that are true of the world in general. When it comes to reasoning about the world, your beliefs are in the driver’s seat. Motivated reasoning is the tendency to process information to get a conclusion we want rather than to discover what is true. Smart people aren’t immune to motivated reasoning and the inside view. In fact, being smart can make it worse because smart people have more confidence in the truth of their beliefs and can spin better narratives to sway other people (and themselves) toward their point of view. A good way to get to the outside view is to look for any base rates that might apply to your situation. Another way to get to the outside view is to seek out other people’s perspectives and feedback. It’s important, however, that they feel comfortable expressing disagreement or a perspective that might cast you in an unflattering light. Otherwise, they’re only amplifying the inside view, strengthening your belief in your accuracy because it feels certified by others. You should be eager to hear people disagree with you and motivate them to do so. Perspective Tracking is a good decision habit to develop. Intentionally considering your situation entirely from the outside view and then entirely from the inside view can get you to a more accurate view that incorporates both. 
    - #[[E: Be thankful when people disagree with you in good faith because they are being kind when they do]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
    - #[[E: The time taken to make a decision should be in proportion to the importance of the decision]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - The key to achieving the right time-accuracy balance is figuring out what the penalty is for making a lower-quality decision than you would have if you had taken more time. How much leeway is there to sacrifice accuracy for speed? The smaller the penalty, the faster you can go. The bigger the penalty, the more time you should take on a decision. The smaller the impact of a poor outcome, the faster you can go. The bigger the impact, the more time you should take. 
        - THE HAPPINESS TEST Ask yourself if the outcome of your decision, good or bad, will likely have a significant effect on your happiness in a year. If the answer is no, the decision passes the test, which means you can speed up. Repeat for a month and a week. The shorter the time period for which your answer is “no, it won’t much affect my happiness,” the more you can trade off accuracy in favor of saving time. 
        - REPEATING OPTIONS When the same type of decision comes up over and over again, you get repeated chances to choose options, including options you may have rejected in the past. These decisions can be made faster.
    - #[[E: A situation where there is an asymmetry between the upside and downside because the potential losses are insignificant is a Freeroll]].  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - The bigger the asymmetry between the upside and downside, the more you have to gain when potential losses are limited, and the bigger the freeroll. 
        - The faster you engage, the less likely it is that the opportunity goes away. The faster you decide to seize the opportunity, the faster you get the chance at realizing the one-sided, upside potential of the decision. 
        - When considering whether a decision has limited downside potential, it’s crucial to think about the cumulative effects of making the same decision repeatedly, rather than focusing on just the onetime, short-run potential harm. 
    - #[[E: Hard decisions can be made quickly]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - The very thing that slows you down—having multiple options that are very close in quality—is actually a signal that you can go fast, because this tells you that whichever option you choose, you can’t possibly be that wrong, since both options have similar upside and downside potential. Instead of thinking about the similarity between options in terms of their overall potential payoffs, both the positives and the negatives, we mostly get focused on anxiety about the downside. What if the option you choose works out badly?

    - #[[E: Quitting is a powerful tool for defraying opportunity cost and gathering intel]]  #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Intel that will allow you to make higher-quality decisions about the things you decide to stick to. Whenever you choose to invest your limited resources in an option, you’re doing so with limited information. As your choice plays out, new information will reveal itself. And sometimes that information will tell you that the option you chose isn’t the best option for advancing you toward your goals. As you learn more, it could be that you figure out that a decision you thought was great actually has much more downside potential than you realized and so has a higher probability to cause you to lose ground rather than gain it. Or it could be that you are gaining ground with the option you chose, but you would gain even more ground if you made a different choice. That’s a good time to consider quitting. 
        - The lower the cost to quit, the faster you can go, because it’s easier to unwind the decision and choose a different option, including options you may have rejected in the past. 
    - #[[E: The cost of quitting is in many cases not prohibitive]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Because of the way the human mind works, we tend to view decisions as permanent and final, particularly if they are high impact. We don’t think much in advance about the option to quit. But once you look at decisions through the frame of quit-to-itiveness, you’ll find that for many decisions you thought (or simply assumed) you couldn’t unwind, the cost isn’t prohibitively high. 
    - #[[E: Decisions where the cost to quit is manageable give you an opportunity to gather information through innovation and experimentation]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson include the concept of a “two-way-door” decision in their decision process. A two-way-door decision is, simply put, a decision where the cost to quit is low. When you figure out that you’ve got a two-way-door decision, you can make choices you’re less certain about, giving yourself more low-risk opportunities to expose yourself to the universe of stuff you don’t know. The information you gather in the process will help you implement the menu strategy, improving your accuracy in sorting options into ones you like and ones you don’t. Try stuff you can quit. Figure out what you like and what you don’t like. Figure out what works and what doesn’t work. 
    - #[[E: Try to take reversible decisions in advance of high-impact decisions, in order to learn more about the possible outcomes]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - You will face lots of high-impact, one-way-door decisions that carry a high cost to unwind (like buying a house, or moving to another country, or changing professions). When you know that you have such a decision on the horizon, consider whether there are lower-impact, easier-to-quit decisions that you can stack in front of the high-impact choice to help inform your one-way-door decision. 
    - #[[E: When the cost to quit is low, you can go fast]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - When you can exercise multiple options in parallel, you can go even faster. When you can do more than one thing at a time, you get many more opportunities to poke at the world, getting the input from multiple experiences. Exercising options in parallel also lowers your exposure to the downside. Even for decisions that have only a 10% chance of going awry, that means that 10% of the time you’ll get a bad outcome. But if you can do a bunch of things at the same time that each have a 10% chance of going awry, the chances that all of them don’t work out becomes vanishingly small. That naturally lowers the penalty for going fast. 
    - #[[E: We spend an enormous amount of time on routine, inconsequential decisions]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - The average person spends 250–275 hours per year deciding what to eat, watch, and wear. That’s the equivalent of the time they spend at work in six or seven weeks. There is a time-accuracy trade-off: Increasing accuracy costs time. Saving time costs accuracy. The key to balancing the trade-off between time and accuracy is figuring out the penalty for not getting the decision exactly right. Getting an initial understanding of the impact of your decision (through the framework of evaluating possibilities, payoffs, and probabilities) will identify situations in which the penalty is small or nonexistent, giving you leeway to sacrifice accuracy in favor of deciding faster. Recognizing when decisions are low impact also maximizes opportunities to poke at the world, which increases your knowledge and helps you learn more about your preferences, improving the quality of all future decisions. You can identify low-impact decisions with the Happiness Test, asking yourself if how your decision turns out will likely have an effect on your happiness in a week, a month, or a year. If the type of thing you are deciding about passes the Happiness Test, you can go fast. If a decision passes the Happiness Test and the options repeat, you can go even faster. A freeroll is a situation in which there is limited downside. Save time deciding whether to seize a freeroll; take time in deciding how to execute it. When you have multiple options that are close in potential payoffs, these are sheep in wolf’s clothing decisions. Close calls for high-impact decisions tend to induce analysis paralysis, but the indecision is, in itself, a signal that you can go fast. To determine if a decision is a sheep in wolf’s clothing, use the Only-Option Test, asking yourself for each option, “If this were the only option I had, would I be happy with it?” If your answer is yes for more than one option, you could flip a coin since you can’t be that wrong whichever option you pick. Allocate your decision time using the menu strategy. Spend time sorting, determining which options you like. Once you have options you like, save time picking. When you pick an option, you’re passing on the potential gains associated with the options you don’t pick. This is the opportunity cost. The higher the opportunity cost, the higher the penalty for making choices that are less certain. You can defray opportunity cost and decide faster by being quit-to-itive, looking at decisions through the framework of whether you can change your mind, quit your choice, and choose something else at a reasonable cost. Decisions with a low cost to quit, known as two-way-door decisions, also provide you with low-cost opportunities to make experimental decisions to gather information and learn about your values and preferences for future decisions. When you’re facing a decision with a high or prohibitive cost of changing your mind, try decision stacking, making two-way-door decisions ahead of the one-way-door decision. You can also defray opportunity cost if you can exercise multiple options in parallel. Because you can rarely approach perfect information or be certain of the outcome of your decision, you will make most decisions while still uncertain. To figure out when additional time is no longer likely to increase accuracy in a worthwhile way, ask yourself, “Is there additional information (available at a reasonable cost) that would establish a clearly preferred option or, if there is already a clearly preferred option, cause you to change your preferred option?” If yes, go find it. If no, decide and move on. 
    - #[[E: Decisions that pass the happiness test can be made quickly]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - THE HAPPINESS TEST:
            - Ask yourself if the outcome of your decision, good or bad, will likely have a significant effect on your happiness in a year. If the answer is no, the decision passes the test, which means you can speed up.
            - Repeat for a month and a week.
            - The shorter the time period for which your answer is “no, it won’t much affect my happiness,” the more you can trade off accuracy in favor of saving time.
    - #[[E: Decisions can simplified in a number of situations]] #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - To determine whether you can decide faster, ask yourself the following questions: 
            - Does the type of thing you’re deciding about pass the Happiness Test? If yes, go fast. 
            - Does it pass the Happiness Test with repeating options? If yes, go even faster. 
            - Are you freerolling? If yes, go fast in seizing the opportunity but take time in the execution. 
            - Is your decision a sheep in wolf’s clothing, with multiple options that pass the Only-Option Test? If yes, go fast, even flipping a coin to make your choice. 
            - Can you quit your choice and pick a different option at a reasonable cost? If yes, go fast. If no, can you decision stack? 
            - Can you exercise multiple options in parallel? If yes, go fast. 
            - Is there additional information (available at a reasonable cost) that would establish a clearly preferred option or, if there is already a clearly preferred option, change your preference? If yes, go find it. If no, decide.

        - Of course, nearly everything changes over time. This includes your emotional state, how much money you make, or the political climate. Paradigms shift, challenges change, market conditions evolve, and technology provides additional solutions as well as creating new problems. When you look forward from the present, status quo bias distorts your view. But if you plan from an imagined point in the future and look back toward the present, you can improve your ability to see beyond what’s immediately in front of you—not just the obstacles farther along the route but how conditions might change. 
    - #[[E: Prospective hindsight allows you to imagine your future self looking back at your present self]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]

    - #[[E: PREMORTEM involves iagining yourself at some time in the future, having failed to achieve a goal, and looking back at how you arrived at that destination]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - STEPS FOR A PREMORTEM 
            - Identify the goal you’re trying to achieve or a specific decision you’re considering. 
            - Figure out a reasonable time period for achieving the goal or for the decision to play out. 
            - Imagine it’s the day after that period of time and you didn’t achieve the goal, or the decision worked out poorly. Looking back from that imagined point in the future, list up to five reasons why you failed due to your own decisions and actions or those of your team. 
            - List up to five reasons why you failed due to things outside your control. 
        - Broadly speaking, there are two categories of stuff that can interfere with achieving a goal: Stuff within your control—your own decisions and actions or, as is often the case in a business setting, the decision and actions of your team Stuff outside of your control—in addition to luck, the decisions and actions of people you have no influence over An effective premortem should produce reasons for failure within each category. 
    - #[[E: In a backcast, you imagine your decision has worked out or you’ve reached your goal and ask, “Why did that happen?”]] #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - The steps for backcasting are similar to those for a premortem. 
        - STEPS FOR A BACKCAST 
            - Identify the goal you’re trying to achieve or a specific decision you’re considering. 
            - Figure out a reasonable time period for achieving the goal or for the decision to play out. 
            - Imagine it’s the day after that period of time and you achieved the goal, or the decision worked out well. Looking back from that imagined point in the future, list up to five reasons why you succeeded due to your own decisions and actions or those of your team. 
            - List up to five reasons why you succeeded due to things outside of your control. 
    - #[[E: The more accurate view of the future lies in the intersection between a premortem and a backcast]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Together, they show you an integrated picture of the future. The premortem reduces the natural tendency toward overconfidence, the illusion of control, and other cognitive biases that cause you to overestimate the chances that things will work out. The backcast evens out the view if you are pessimistic in nature or underconfident. Most important, you’re doing more than just imagining success and failure. You’re identifying the paths that lead to both results, and multiple ways to access the path to success, as well as the obstacles you have to avoid or manage. 
    - #[[E: TILT occurs when a bad outcome causes you to be in an emotionally hot state that compromises the quality of your decision-making]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - Let’s say things aren’t going your way on some project in which you’ve already invested a bunch of resources. You’re unlikely to quit in those situations, even when an objective observer would see that quitting is appropriate. In the wake of a bad outcome, it’s difficult to see the situation rationally. If you could get to the outside view you would quit, but you don’t because you’re stuck in the inside view. That’s the sunk cost fallacy, another example of tilt. 
        - When you consider how you might respond to negative outcomes in advance of those things happening, you’re likely to think more rationally. It’s easier to come up with the appropriate course of action to take when things don’t go your way before those things go wrong than it is after they go wrong. 
        - Consider using the same tools for preparing in advance for your reaction to unexpectedly positive outcomes as you do for unexpectedly bad ones.

    - #[[E: We are pretty good at setting positive goals for ourselves. Where we fall flat is at executing the things we need to do to achieve them]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]
        - The gap between the things we know we should do and the decisions we later make is known as the behavior gap. The message of the power of positive thinking is that you’ll succeed if you imagine yourself succeeding. Whether explicitly or by reasonable inference, the message is also that failure is the result of thinking about failure. Despite the importance of setting positive goals, positive visualization alone won’t give you the best route to success. Negative thinking helps you identify things that might get in your way so you can identify ways to reach your destination more efficiently. Thinking about how things can go wrong is known as **mental contrasting**. You imagine what you want to accomplish and confront the barriers in the way of accomplishing it. You can identify more potential obstacles by combining mental contrasting with mental time travel, picturing yourself in the future having failed to achieve a goal, and then looking back at what got you to that outcome. Looking back from an imagined future at the route that got you there is called **prospective hindsight**. A **premortem** combines prospective hindsight with mental contrasting. To do a premortem, you place yourself in the future and imagine that you have failed to achieve your goal. You then consider the potential reasons things worked out poorly. In addition to helping individuals, premortems can help teams minimize groupthink and maximize access to the outside view by eliciting more diversity of opinions. This is especially true if team members do the premortem independently before discussing it as a group. A companion technique to a premortem is **backcasting**, where you work backward from a positive future to figure out why you succeeded. You can turn the output of premortems and backcasts, for easy reference, into a **Decision Exploration Table**, which also includes an estimate of the chances of the reasons for failure and success occurring. Given what you’ve learned from creating a Decision Exploration Table, the first thing to ask is whether you should modify your goal or change your decision. Once you’ve established that you’re sticking with your goal or decision, you can create precommitment contracts, which raise barriers to behavior that interfere with your success or lower barriers to encourage behavior that promotes your success. You can also prepare for your reaction to setbacks along the way to your goal. People compound negative outcomes by making poor decisions after a bad result. **Tilt** is a common reaction that occurs in the wake of a bad result. The what-the-hell effect and the sunk cost fallacy are examples of tilt. Planning for your reaction allows you to create precommitments, establish criteria for changing course, and dampen your emotional reaction in the wake of a setback. The Dr. Evil game helps identify and address additional ways your behavior in the future might undermine your success. In the game, you note the ways that Dr. Evil would control your mind to make you fail through decisions that are justifiable as one-offs but unjustifiable over time. The Dr. Evil game can encourage you to adopt a precommitment called a category decision, where you decide in advance what options you can and cannot choose when you face a decision that falls within that category. You can also address potential bad luck by hedging, paying for something that mitigates the impact of a downside event occurring.

        - The only way somebody can know that they’re disagreeing with you is if they know what you think first. Keeping that to yourself when you elicit feedback makes it more likely that what they say is actually what they believe. 
    - #[[E: FRAMING EFFECT is a cognitive bias in which the way that information is presented influences the way that the listener makes decisions about the information]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]

    - #[[E: One of the best ways to improve the quality of your beliefs is to get other people’s perspectives]]. #Evergreens #Productivity [[How to Decide]]'
        - When their beliefs diverge from yours, it improves your decision-making by exposing you to corrective information and the stuff you don’t know. Beliefs are contagious. Informing somebody of your belief before they give their feedback significantly increases the likelihood that they will express the same belief back to you. Exercise decision hygiene to stem the infection of beliefs. The only way somebody can know that they’re disagreeing with you is if they know your opinion first. Keep your opinions to yourself when you elicit feedback. The frame you choose can signal whether you have a positive or negative view about what you’re trying to get feedback on. Stay in neutral as much as possible. The word “disagree” has very negative connotations. Using “divergence” or “dispersion” of opinion instead of “disagreement” is a more neutral way of talking about places where people’s opinions differ. Outcomes can also infect the quality of feedback. Quarantine others from the way things turned out while eliciting their feedback. When you’re asking for feedback about something that’s happened in the past and several outcomes are sitting in the way, iterate feedback. For feedback of any kind, put the person, as closely as possible, into the state of knowledge you were in when you made the decision. Group settings offer the potential of improving decision quality if you can access the different perspectives of the group. Often, this potential is undermined by the tendency of groups to coalesce around consensus quickly, discouraging members with information or opinions that disagree with the consensus from sharing them. Groups can better fulfill their decision-making potential by exercising group decision hygiene, soliciting initial opinions and rationales independently before sharing with the group. Due to the halo effect, opinions from high-status members of the group are especially contagious. Anonymizing feedback on the first pass allows ideas to be better considered on their merits rather than according to the status of the individual who holds the belief. For lower-impact, easier-to-reverse decisions, the group can still contain the contagion through a quick-and-dirty version of this process, where group members write down their opinions and someone reads them aloud or writes them on a whiteboard before discussion, or where members read their own opinions aloud in reverse order of seniority. The quality of feedback is limited by the quality of the input into the feedback elicitation process. We tend to spin narratives that highlight, lowlight, or even omit information that isn’t helpful to the conclusion that we would like others to reach. Give the other person what they need to know to give you a quality opinion and no more. Access the outside view by asking yourself, “If someone came to me asking my opinion about this kind of decision, what would I need to know to give good advice?” Build a checklist of relevant details for repeating decisions and make that checklist before you’re in the midst of a decision. Such a list should focus on the applicable goals, values, and resources, along with the details of the situation. Members of a group should hold one another accountable to the checklist. If someone is eliciting feedback and they can’t provide details on the checklist, there should be an agreement not to give feedback.
