    - Went #bathing , 17 C in the air and 11 C in the water. Sunny. A joy. [[HT_Bathing]] regularly, I have begun to feel quite comfortable in the cold water. Stayed in for 3 minutes this time.
    - While making cabbage sallad and washing dishes, I listened to two audio tracks on [[Bookmobile]] which I had saved from [[youtube]]:

        - The CEO of [[Evernote]] talked about the reengineering of the product to a common platform for PC, Mac, Android, IOS. Also, organising around functionality rather than technology. He expects that the company will now be able to deliver innovation at a much faster pace during 2020-2021.

    - Phoned [[Com Hem]] to find out find out how to stop machine voice overlay on TV in connection with tv-text. Got cut off after a half hour in a telephone queue, tried again and got through after another half hour. It's a known problem, they are working on it and will deliver a solution soon, maybe today. It may be necessary to restart the Tivo in order to download the update.
