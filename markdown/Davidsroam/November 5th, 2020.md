    - #Poem by [[e e cummings]] 
        - ## I Carry Your Heart With Me (I Carry It In)
        - Song by Ana Cervantes and E. E. Cummings
            - I carry your heart with me(i carry it in
            - My heart)i am never without it(anywhere
            - I go you go, my dear; and whatever is done
            - By only me is your doing, my darling)
            - I fear
            - No fate(for you are my fate, my sweet)i want
            - No world(for beautiful you are my world, my true)
            - And it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
            - And whatever a sun will always sing is you
            - Here is the deepest secret nobody knows
            - (Here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
            - And the sky of the sky of a tree called life; which grows
            - Higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)
            - And this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart
            - I carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)

    - Listening to a recording of a talk with [[Wayne Liqourman]]. He talks about the illusion of authorship as the source of unnecessary suffering. Also the "Flip Flop" of seeking (open awareness/ contracted awareness) Very clear and to the point. #Podcast #Philosophy
    - [[Kerstin]] has driven to see her mother. She gave [[Amanda]] a lift to Katrineholm, [[Amanda]] will continue from there to Ã…sbro to visit with [[Lukas]].
    - Went [[bathing]]. quite windy. The wind creates movement in the water, which makes it feel colder.

    - [[Esther]] called to say how thrilled she was with the presents we had sent her, a calendar we had made with pictures of the family, some more prints of [[Samuel]] and family, mittens to [[Joe]], a necklace from [[Amanda]] which she herself had made. [[Esther]] mentioned that [[Samuel]] had found out that customs had cleared his computers, but that the computers need to be opened in front of the customs officials. He will do this tomorrow.
