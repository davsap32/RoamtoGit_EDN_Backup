    - The “Advaita experience” or “Zen kensho” is seeing clearly that life sort of happens, out of our control, and that our sense of “I” is a story.

And the first time we become fully aware of this may get etched in our memories. At least that’s how it went with me. For you the experience may be quite different. The shape of our awakenings does not matter much. In any case, there is nothing to teach and there is not much to discuss.

Attempts to “revive” that first experience and attempts to theorize about it are misguided because they are preventing the natural flow of life. I certainly made these attempts, but in vain, and in retrospect they were mistaken. Why? Because life just sort of happens, because flow is what matters, and because there is not much to say about all that.

We tell ourselves stories about ourselves all the time, and once we are aware of that some of these stories can start to dissolve and fade away. One story I used to tell myself is that I was exceptionally bright. That’s what people around me told me when I grew up, and I believed them. But that story has been a hindrance to my development. When I dropped all the stories that made me ‘special’, my life became much simpler, and my relationships with people improved greatly. There is absolutely no need anymore to feel special. And this shedding of stories about “me” is still going on. And my life is getting simpler and simpler. 
    - Drink Your Tea

Drink your tea slowly and reverently,
as if it is the axis
on which the world earth revolves
– slowly, evenly, without
rushing toward the future;
Live the actual moment.
Only this moment is life.

– Thich Nhat Hanh 
    - The minute I heard my first love story,
I started looking for you, not knowing
how blind that was.
Lovers don’t finally meet somewhere.
They’re in each other all along.

– Jalaluddin Rumi
