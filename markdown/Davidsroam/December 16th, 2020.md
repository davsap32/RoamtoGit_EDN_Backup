    - No planned meetings today - feels good. #Work
    - Muscle pain in my left thigh. What can it be? It is several days since I did PT, so it is unlikely to be training pain, but I can't see what else it could be. It's a PT day today, I intend to train as usual but to pay attention to any increase in pain. #Illness
    - [[Kerstin]] is back from [[Arboga]] - she enjoyed it.
    - Next PT: [[December 20th, 2020]]

    - It occurs to me that my hip pain may be due to my daily sitting for breathing exercises and meditation. I could do the breathing exercises lying down and skip the meditation for a few days, to see if the hip pain diminishes. #Illness
