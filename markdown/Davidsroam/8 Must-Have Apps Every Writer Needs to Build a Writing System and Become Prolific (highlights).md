    - In the words of Stephen King:

“If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.” 
    - The magic doesn’t happen in your writing. The magic happens in the system you build yourself to support your writing. 
    - A system is the set of tools, routines, and rituals you have cemented in place to propel you forward to your desired outcome. 
    - An App or Tool to Summarize and Synthesize Your Inputs 
    - if you aren’t able to ship content regularly, you’ll simply fail to amplify your voice in the fast-moving online world. 
    - in the writer’s world — you are what you read. If you don’t have quality input, you cannot hatch and breed quality output. It’s as simple as that. 
    - As Stephen King explains in his book, On Writing:

“If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time (or the tools) to write. Simple as that. Reading is the creative center of a writer’s life.” 
    - You need a system that would allow you to forge connections through the network of information and knowledge you’ve compounded over time because that’s how you birth new and novel ideas.

What you need is a note-taking app 
    - Ideas Board: Anytime I land on an idea that could make a great article, I add it as a note under one of the following categories: Self-development, Thinking Better, Productivity, Entrepreneurship, or Creative Writing Advice. At this very moment, I have 20 article ideas listed on this board. 
    - When I land on an interesting article, I use the one-click chrome extension to save it on my Instapaper.
When I’m ready to read, I open up my account and browse through the list of unread articles I had saved.
As I’m reading, I use their highlighter feature to highlight the quotes I want to remember.
As soon as I’m done with an article, if I like it, I save it into one of my folders (productivity, mindset, mindfulness, research, etc.) so I can retrieve it if I ever want to reference back to it, and if I want to discard of it, I simply delete it 
    - An App or Tool to Add More Weight to Your Words 
    - as a writer, you must keep your reader’s experience in your rearview mirror. What do you want them to feel? The answer to that question determines the kind of words you will want to lean into — because it’s your choice of words, and the manner in which you sculpt them, that spark the reader’s imagination. 
    - You add depth and weight to your words.

And how do you that?

Use a thesaurus.

The idea is not to complicate your work or try and make it sound more sophisticated by using longer words. The idea is to make your writing sound more poetic because poetry evokes emotion and that’s how you move people with your words. 
    - An App or Tool to Manage Your Grammar
Out of all the apps on this list, Grammarly is the most important when it comes to your actual writing. 
    - This free headline analyzer tool will “analyze your headline to determine the Emotional Marketing Value (EMV) score based on proprietary analysis technology developed by the Advanced Marketing Institute.” You simply type in the headline and it provides you with a score that portrays the emotions your headline triggers: intellectual, empathetic, or spiritual. 
    - The magic doesn’t happen in your writing. The magic happens in the system you build yourself to support your writing. 
    - I’ve built myself a dashboard to track my progress. I know how many articles I publish per month, on which platform, my monthly earnings, and how my follower and subscriber counts are growing and at what growth rate.
