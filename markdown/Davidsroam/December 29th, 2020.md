    - Called Åby vårdcentral this morning to ask for treatment for difficulty in urinating. The nurse will talk to the doctor about what to do next and will contact me after that. I feel a bit silly for having waited so long to contact the medical service. #Illness
    - Still feeling the effects of #Sciatica #Illness
    - Sent a secure e-message to [[SHB]] to ask them to terminate the custody account that I have together with [[Samuel]]. He has to send a similar message and then the bank will terminate the account.
