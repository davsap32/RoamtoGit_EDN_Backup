    - The [[Telia Media Access TG799vac]] router kept dropping connections, so I have removed it and replaced it with the [[Dlink DIR-815]] router. #[[Home Tech]]
    - [[Kerstin]] has wished for a portable radio which she can have in her room downstairs. I ordered one from [[Cdon]]: #[[Home Tech]]

        - The sorting function seems to have stopped working for my [[Habit-tracker]] attribute table [[Roam Research]]. Updated from the [gitmurf homepage](https://gitmurf.github.io/roam-javascript/#attribute-table-filters). Works now.

    - Reading an article at [[thrivinghenry.com]] titled "Roamkasten - a practical how to guide to optimize Zettelkasten in Roam Research" - based on a book club study of [[Sönke Ahrens]] book. Lots to think about. [Link to article](https://www.thrivinghenry.com/writings/roamkasten-a-practical-how-to-guide-to-optimize-zettelkasten-in-roam-research). I am considering using CSS code for Zettelkasten tags referred to in this tweet:

    - Waiting for a call from Folktandvården. This morning they did not phone when they said they would, I tried to phone them and at that moment they called and the call failed because the phone was busy. They called again a bit later and terminated the call before I had a chance to pick up. Now they were supposed to call at 3pm, I’m keeping the phone nearby and hoping they call.
    - I got the call from Folktandvården - booked an appointment for [[January 5th, 2021]] 13:00.

    - Browsing [[Sönke Ahrens]] book - it may be worth rereading and highlighting. #[[Digital Garden]]
    - Spoke with [[Esther]], she had suffered from diarrhea today, she suspects due to having eaten of a chicken dish that had been in the fridge for too long.

    - I just realised that a common custody account that [[Samuel]] and I created many years ago is costing us 25 SEK each month and has been doing so for mamy years. Time to close it!
