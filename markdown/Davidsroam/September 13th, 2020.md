    - When [[Kerstin]] saw [[Samuel]]'s new (very large) TV yesterday evening, she longed to have a similar one. It won't fit between the bookcases and the loudspeakers as it is now - the screen is 158,1 cm wide and the gap is about 157 cm. We could move a bookshelf to make place, but  [[Kerstin]] is keen to get rid of the large loudspeakers and replace them with smaller ones.  If we are to remove the large loudspeakers from the lounge, I would prefer to have them in my workroom rather than selling them. I have place for them there. If we move them, we have to look for new loudspeakers for the lounge. [[Samuel]] bought his on campaign from [[Webhallen]], there are few left at the campaign price there. There are a limited number in store at the same price at [[MediaMarkt]] in [[Norrköping]], we could buy it there today. [Link](https://www.prisjakt.nu/produkt.php?p=5392491). #[[Home Tech]]
    - We had returned some tough entrecote we had bought at [[ICA Maxi]] and mentioned to [[Samuel]] how dissapointed we were. He recommends that we shoud shop at [[TK MEAT MARKET]]. [Link](https://www.tkmeatmarket.se/).
    - [[Samuel]] recommended the #Documentary [[The Social Dilemma]] on [[Netflix]]
    - [[SHB]] schedule for the coming week:

    - Went #bathing in [[Lillsjön]], 14 C in the air, 11 C in the water. Stayed in the water for 2 minutes but did not swim, it felt too cold for that. Very windy.
    - Spoke with [[Kerstin]] about purchasing a new TV. We agreed that it is not a priority - the one we have now works fine. But we will look at new speakers. #[[Home Tech]]
- 14:28
    - Listening to [[The Knowledge Project]] #Podcast with [[Shane Parrish]] and [[Ross Hudson]] entitled [[The Pursuit of Presence]]. About the [[Eneagram]] as a tool for self-analysis and personal development. This seems interesting - I would like to read more about the [[Eneagram]]. #[[Psychology]] #Philosophy
    - Started washing windows, [[Kerstin]] on the inside and me on the outside. It started raining after a short while, so I'll have to come back to the window washing project.
- 16:34
    - Watching a #Video by [[Brian Johnson]] in which he recommends his 10 favourite books: #Books
        - [[The Tools]] by [[Barry Michels]] and [[Phil Stutz]] #Readit
        - [[Deep Work]] by [[Cal Newport]]
        - [[Happy Together]] by [[Susan Pileggi Pawelski]] 
        - [[Why we Sleep]] by [[Matthew Walker]]
        - [[Food Fix]] by [[Mark Hyman]] #Acquire
        - [[The Joy of Movement]] by [[Kelly McGonigal]]
        - [[The Oxygen Advantage]] by [[Patrick McKeown]]
        - [[Digital Minimalism]] by [[Cal Newport]]
        - [[Tiny Habits]] by [[BJ Fogg]]
        - [[Spiritual Economics]] by [[Eric Butterworth]] #Acquire
    - 
    - I am struggling with [[History of Western Philosophy]], it is full of details I have to skim over and will take me weeks to read. I am at 30% so far. I'm keen to read stuff that will give me more material for my [[Digital Garden]]. So I'm going to get started on the above list.
- 19:13
    - While washing the dishes, I listened to an episode of [[The Zero Hour]] #Podcast with [[RJ Eskow]] ahd [[Thomas Frank]], about the populist movement in USA. The populist movement aimed at providing ordinary people (=working class) with a say in politics and was violently opposed by the Republican party - who presented it as a threat to democracy. [[Thomas Frank]] has recently come out with a book titled [[The People, No: A Brief History of Anti-Populism]].

    - Started reading [[The Tools]], these exercises can be useful for me.  I am thinking of my shyness in photographing people. Have read about 40% of the book. #Books #[[Psychology]]
    - [[Helene]] called [[Kerstin]] from Washington. She is still in quarantine, spennding time walking around getting acquainted with the town.
    - Highlighting using the [[Kindle]] app on [[Onyx]] does not work very well - the available highlight colors blend with the light background color. So I’m reading [[The Tools]] on my [[Ipad]]. #[[Home Tech]]
