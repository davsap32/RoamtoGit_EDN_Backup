    - dreamt of being eaten by crocodiles. #Dreams

    - dreamt of having to save [[Kerstin]] and [[Amanda]] from a bus that has driven off the road into water and was full of water. By picking up the bus and pouring out the water. #Dreams

    - I received the [[Logitech Bluetooth Audio Adapter]] that I had ordered with the intention of using it to bridge between my  [[Airpod Pros]] and my [[SHB]] PC. I could not pair the [[Airpod Pros]] with the adapter and have written to Logitech to ask them how this should be done. I have received a ticket no: 4166367. Time expended: About an hour.

    - I went #bathing just as it started to rain. It wasn't raining much while I bathed, but by the time I got home it was raining  heavily. Still not very cold in the water - I didn't measure today but I guess about 14 C.
    - I completed going through highlights for two books: [[Rapt]] (which I abandoned at about 20%) and [[The Tools]] (which gives me food for thought: this is perhaps a new practice to learn). So now I have lots of [[Evergreens]], the question is what is the next step. Alternatives: #Books [[Digital Garden]]
        - Keep reading and adding more [[Evergreens]]. 
            - I can review by booklist and choose something which awakens my curiosity. Adding [[Evergreens]] is not an end in itself.
        - Decide on a topic for my own writing. Alternatives:
            - **Habits and practices for myself going forward.** I don't think that there is much to write about on this subject. My habits and practices are in good shape, I just need to try the practices in [[The Tools]] and/or [[WOOP]]
        - Continue to review my [[Digital Garden]], refining formulations and connecting [[Evergreens]]
- 15:20
    - [[Kerstin]] mentioned at lunch that she thought I was hostile towards [[Marianne]]. Not my intention, but I do not feel comfortable in her presence and obviously it shows. I tend to keep out of the way when she is here. The question is with what do I feel uncomfortable and can I get over it?
        - With what do I feel uncomfortable?
            - [[Marianne]] has a way of trying to tease or provoke me which I dislike
            - [[Marianne]] has a way of conversing which hinders reflection in conversation. She is in a hurry to tell her stories and takes as much of the available airtime as she can get. 
        - What's really going on?
            - [[Marianne]] has low status in my eyes. She strikes me as shallow. But why can I not show her warmth anyway. What is stopping me? 
            - This may be an example of a hangup which cannot be resolved through thinking. Perhaps I should try one of the practices in [[The Tools]].

        - [[Marianne]] came to pick berries in the forest and stayed for dinner.
        - [[Kerstin]] took [[Amanda]] to the hospital today for a gyneacological checkup, they found cysts on her ovaries, which is worrying for her. They have called her to a new checkup at the end of October? I spoke to [[Esther]] this evening and mentioned the cysts, [[Esther]] was not overly worried, she thinks that an oral contraceptive would hold the cysts in check. 
        - [[Amanda]] had her first day of work at [[Angry Creative]] today, according to [[Kerstin]] she felt overwhelmed by all the new systems and routines she has to learn.
        - I have started reading [[The Psychology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed, and Happiness]], it seems very good. I'd like [[Samuel]] to read it. #Books
        - [[Roam42]] has added some new functionality (Deep Nav) which I can try out. The help for [[Roam42]] is available through Alt-Shift-H. 
            - In Roam42, pull up the help menu and click on the settings button for Deep Nav. Enable it. Then ALT+G.
