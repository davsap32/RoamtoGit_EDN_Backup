    - I will take care of the grandchildren for a time while [[Kerstin]] fetches [[Amanda]] to bring her home for lunch and [[Samuel]] and [[Josefine]] are looking at stuff for their upstair bathroom.

    - [[Samuel]] and [[Josefine]] fetched their children a short while ago, they had been out purchasing stuff to their bathroom.
    - I have been looking at alternatives for wall heaters, [[Samuel]]'s friend [[Henrik]] had recommended the [[Adax]] brand. These can be purchased at Elgiganten, I think I should get a 1200 heater.

        - The elements we have at the moment use 220V. The radiator in my study is 140 x 60 cm
        - I will have to put in wall outlets for the elements, the ones we have at the moment are fed by cables without outlets.
        - An alternative to purchasing a new element is to purchase a "Smart wall plug" with an inbuilt thermostat and wifi. As far I I can understand, this would not be an inferior alternative to replacing the element itself.

    - Listening to a #Podcast with [[Tim Ferris]] and [[Naval Ravikant]]. Ravikant talks about his principles for acquiring wealth. Interesting.
