    - [[Kenneth]] called yesterday to mention that he would be adding a slideshow to the video birthday greeting to [[Esther]]. I was welcome to add my own contribution if I wanted to. I made a slideshow of some of the old family pictures and uploaded it via Vidhug. I had to use the Win10 video editor, as there seems to be a bug in [[Lightroom]] which hangs when exporting slideshow to video.
