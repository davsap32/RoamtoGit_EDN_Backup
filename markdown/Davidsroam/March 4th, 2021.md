    - When I spoke with [[Esther]]yesterday evening, she mentioned that the wireless doorbell that Ernest keeps in his room rang twice during the night recently, without her having pressed the button. I had no idea during our conversation how this might have occured, now it occurs to me that there might be a similar apparatus in the vicinity that operates on the same frequency.
