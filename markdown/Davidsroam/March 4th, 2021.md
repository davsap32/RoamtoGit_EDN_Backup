    - Yesterday evening, watched the film [[Small Axe]] together with [[Kerstin]] - very good. #Films
    - Also, saw some of the second episode of [[Star Trek: Picard]]. I am dubious about following the rest of the series. #Films

    - When I spoke with [[Esther]]yesterday evening, she mentioned that the wireless doorbell that Ernest keeps in his room rang twice during the night recently, without her having pressed the button. I had no idea during our conversation how this might have occured, now it occurs to me that there might be a similar apparatus in the vicinity that operates on the same frequency.

    - On [[lithub.com]], I read an interview with [[Anne Lamott]] about the craft of writing. She recommended the book [[A Swim in a Pond in the Rain]] by [[George Saunders]], which I would like to read. #Books #[[Creative writing]]
    - On [[Medium]], read a recommendation of the [[Daevabad Trilogy]] by [[S.A.Chakraborty]]: #Books

    - I still have symptoms of a cold, but they have lightened somewhat. #Illness

    - Went for a long walk. Pleasant.
    - Listened to a #Podcast with [[Robert Salzman]] and [[Jim Newman]]. Interesting at times, but at times a tendency for Jim to claim a dogmatic certainty.
    - Listening to a #Podcast in the [[Demistifying Science]] series with [[Dr. Vaibhav Diwadkar]] about how reasonable levels of discomfort can be beneficial.
    - Saw a post on [[Twitter]] about a new book about gene editing, [[The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race]] by [[Walter Isaacson]], which I would much like to read. #Books
