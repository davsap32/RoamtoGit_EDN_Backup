    - We both slept badly - we had eaten too much, a three course dinner at Ulla Winbladhs, on top of which [[Kerstin]] had hip pain after walking so much yesterday so she could not get comfortable in bed. Each time she moved, she woke me and the other way round. In the end she moved to the sofa, after which we could both sleep for a while. 
    - We spent the morning and some of the afternoon tidying and cleaning my flat, which was more fun to do together than alone. We got a lot done but there is much still to do. We ate a good lunch at restaurant Aiyara near the flat. We took the subway to town at about three this afternoon and we're lucky to be able to join a guided tour of Hallwylska Palace, just the two of us and the guide.
    - [[Kerstin]]s hip pain may become a real handicap, as it is now she cannot walk far before feeling pain.
    - While we were working in the flat I updated Win10 on my computer, it took more than a day to catch up with all the updates since I was last here in March. I searched the picture catalogs on the internal drive of the computer for the images from Hults Bruk from 20151122, and was pleased to find them, hidden in their own picture folder, quite apart from all the other images from 2015. I will take a copy back with me to update her [[Lightroom Desktop]] catalog at home.
    - This evening we will eat dinner with [[Helene]] and [[Johan]] at [[Downtown Camper Hotel]]
