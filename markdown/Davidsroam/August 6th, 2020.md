    - #[[Digital Garden]] I have started watching a [video ](https://youtu.be/A6PIrVZoZAk)on [[youtube]] titled " Professor [[Joel Chan]]- Zettelkasten and Evergreen Notes for Generative Thought". There is a discussion about what a Zettel or #[[Evergreens]] should be. For him, a Zettle is a statement or a proposal, e.g "Z: Knowledge must be recontextualized to be usefully reused by others". Each Zettle is preceded with **Z:**, so that when he begins writing a Zettle name in double brackets, all the Zettles turn up in the list of alternatives. Here is a screenshot from the video:

    - {{[[DONE]]}} I should watch another interview in the same series titled "Roam Research Tour with Egghead.io's Maggie Appleton - Evergreen Notes and Digital Gardens" [Link](https://youtu.be/RXXXHN516qc). #Video #[[Digital Garden]]
    - I cancelled my subscription to [[Nebula]], I started a trial yesterday in order to be able to browse the content (mostly looking for content by [[Ali Abdaal]] not available on [[youtube]]), I found little there to motivate a paid subscription.
    - #[[Digital Garden]] Based on a comment by [[Joel Chan]], I read through some of [[Andy Matuschak]]s writing on #[[Evergreens]]. Here is a quote:
        - #Quotes from [[Andy Matuschak]]
            - most people who write about note-taking don’t seem particularly accomplished in their own fields, whatever those may be. In fact, most such writers aren’t applying their notes to some exogenous creative problem: their primary creative work __is__ writing about [[Productivity]]. These writers offer advice on note-taking to help scientists and executives with the challenges of their work, but the advice was developed in a context disconnected from those external realities. There are two related problems here: [Effective system design requires insights drawn from serious contexts of use](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3H98n8DGZmu8XArqHZVsckyWvbTe8wK4kAt2), and [Powerful enabling environments usually arise as a byproduct of projects pursuing their own intrinsically meaningful purposes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4N6d29XL2PZXCa64HPcxA64RGWDb6Cagc1gs).
I think that the same discussion can be had about #[[Photography]]. Photography that is an end in itself compared to Photography as a tool to work with something in the "real world"

    - We ate lunch with [[Carl-Otto]] and [[Cecilia]] at their summer cottage, it was a very warm day and we sat in the shade of a tree in their garden, very pleasant. As usual, I was ready to leave an hour or two before we actually did so. I got stung by a bee on my cheek during a walk around their property, I came too close to one of [[Carl-Otto]]'s beehives. Quite painful. 
    - [[Helene]] sent a message from my flat in Stockholm, there was a bad smell in the flat because the toilet bowl had dried up, she filled that and all the drains with water and aired out the flat. She seems to think that the flat is OK, that they will be happy to stay there.
    - I spoke to [[Esther]] as I do daily, there is still an issue with [[Joe]]s sciatica, but he can sleep in his bed so far, which is the main thing.
    - #Books Watched part of a video by [[Mickey Mellen]] on "How to use filters in Roam Research". He uses the book length in hours (fetched from Audible.com) as an attribute to indicate the size of the book. Good idea, i think.
    - #Books Started reading [[The Elephant in the Brain]] by [[Kevin Simler & Robin Hanson]]. About the fact that our motives are mostly about sex, power and social status, but that we mostly convince ourselves that they have more of an altruistic component than they actually have.
    - #[[Digital Garden]] Wacthing a video on [[youtube]] with [[Maggie Appleton]], she talks about [[Seedlings]] which are potential #[[Evergreens]] but have not been developed enough yet. She also describes how she uses **Keyboard maestro**, which is a macro utility for the Mac, to format text before pasting into [[Roam Research]]. [Link to relevant webpage](https://maggieappleton.com/roam-garden/). [Link to video](https://youtu.be/RXXXHN516qc) The video is part of [[Robert Haisfield]]s roam tour on [[youtube]]. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAguQH5EvMCqz_-r48Bmcg7EkOi8Iwz_x)
[[Maggie Appleton]] also describes her notetaking process, which is stepwise, adding notes into roam as she reads and not waiting to finish the book before adding all the notes at once.

    - watching a documentary on TV on the development and deployment of the first atomic bomb.
    - started litening to a [[Podcast]], an episode of the THE EZRA KLEIN SHOW with [[Masha Gessen]]. Title: “the frightening fragility of America’s political institutions”. Listened at 1.5x speed, seems ok.
