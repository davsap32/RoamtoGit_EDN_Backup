    - Dr. [[Sara Seaton]] called today. My tests are all ok, no infection, no blood or sugar in my urine, PSA normal (1,4 Âµg/L). She will still refer me to a urologist to check on my prostate. She issued presciptions for two medicines to reduce swelling of the prostate, I started taking them this evening. #Illness
