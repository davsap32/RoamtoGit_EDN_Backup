    - Yesterday evening, [[Samuel]] asked us to take care of the children this evening, as he and [[Josefine]] were invited out. I was not keen, as we will have a family gathering tomorrow to celebrate [[Amanda]], I thought it would all be too much. So we said no, but having slept on it [[Kerstin]] said this morning that she thought we should take care of the children this evening and have the family here for lunch tomorrow. I was a bit unwilling but said ok.
