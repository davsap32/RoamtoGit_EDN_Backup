    - We went to [[Samuel]]’s  house where we worked together to set up some granite blocks to line their parking. The tarmac people will be there tomorrow and on Tuesday, [[Samuel]] wanted everything to be ready for them.
    - [[Samuel]] has valued the house to 6 MSek, he can now borrow more money on the house at low interest, so he is planning to have everything done that they have not done yet. Shower and toilet upstairs, radiators in the new section, painting of the outside, perhaps a glass veranda. He is looking for a firm to take all of this on.
    - [[Samuel]] seems fine after his fall yesterday - he was playing chase with Alice and fell and hit his head. 
    - I did a weekly review today:
        - checked all my todos. For this I built a query on the [[TODO]] page. 
        - checked through my [[Instapaper]] records
        - checked through my [[Getpocket]] records.
        - The review of [[Instapaper]] and [[Getpocket]] was not particularly thourough, I got lost in some of the articles and videos. I will have to return to these and take more time.

    - While washing the dishes, listened to a podcast with [[Scott Barry Kaufman]] and [[Carol Dweck]] about the science of [[Growth Mindset]]. Looking forward to reading [[Carol Dweck]]'s book. #Books #Psychology
    - Saw an interview with [[Martin Hägglund]] whose book [[This Life]] has just come out in Swedish. A popularly acclaimed book on #Philosophy. I should look into it.
