    - Rainy today, probably won't go #bathing unless there is a pause in the rain.
    - I signed up for a one-year subscription to [[Medium]].

    - Remembering a dream from last night in which I heard a noise in the house and went into the kitchen to find a stranger there. In the dream I shouted at the stranger (with difficulty, because of being fearful) to leave. #Dreams

    - When there was a pause in the rain, I walked with [[Kerstin]] to [[Lillsjön]] to bathe, but as we got there and before I could bathe, it started raining heavily, so we tirned around. I didn’t want to have to put on wet clothes after having bathed in the cold water.
    - We made juice of beetroots and apples. We have so many apples, we will give a bag of them to [[Samuel]].

    - Just returned from dinner with [[Samuel]] and family - very pleasant. It didn’t fell as tense as it did the last time we had dinner together.
