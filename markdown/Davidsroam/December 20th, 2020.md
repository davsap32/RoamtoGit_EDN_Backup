    - Not entirely healthy - leg pain, painful and frequent urination, "under the weather". #Illness
    - I seem to have a short attention span for reading. Two ways forward: #Books
        - Pomodoro - read for a given set time no matter what.
        - Look for books that interest me more.

    - Went [[bathing]] before lunch. Mild weather and no wind, less cloud cover so quite bright. Very pleasant.
    - [[Kerstin]] has scrubbed the floor of the shower/toilet. I have dusted the top shelves of the bookcases in the lounge and raked up leaves in the garden. #[[Sort and Tidy]]

    - Looked up papers from my treatment for [[BPH]], which was in autumn 2005, using a method called TUNA. At "Urologi och Inkontinenskliniken". It feels as it it is time to see a doctor about BPH and possibly urinary tract infection. #Illness

    - Participated in a Zoom meeting with my school comrades from [[Allan Wilson High School]]. [[Roy Rosser]], [[Dave Crossley]], [[Brendan Remenyi]], [[Graham Wood]], [[Colin Attwell]]. Enjoyed it. It lasted about an hour , which was quite enough.
