- So far I have identified commonalities between propositions in different sources. The next step after that will be to generate new propositions. To begin with, it will be a matter of reading  and rereading the notes. 
- According to [[Lukas Kawerau]] in the [[Galaxy Brain]] course. I should pose questions (One question per page) for which answers can be found in the #Evergreens
- [[Nat Eliason]] does not explicitly use [[Evergreens]], he uses [[Progressive summarization]]. He recommends creating [[Header Pages]] for chosen subjects. Material can be collected from relevant sources into the [[Header Pages]].

        - # Evergreen notes
        - __Evergreen notes__ are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects. This is an unusual way to think about writing notes: [Most people take only transient notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2ZAGQBHuJ2u9WrtAQHAEHcCZTtqpsGkAsrD1). That’s because these practices aren’t about writing notes; they’re about effectively developing insight: [“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7kEFe6NfUSgtaDuUjST1oczKKzQQeQWk4Dbc). When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: [Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be).
        - It’s hard to write notes that are worth developing over time. These principles help:

        - This concept evolves in large part from Niklas Luhmann’s [Zettelkasten](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2QvtE9w5zs49x7WUeG8Ut1vywHDLiG2Wkm9p), which he regards as the independent intellectual partner in writing his 70 books.
