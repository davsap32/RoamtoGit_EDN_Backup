    - we see the perfect storm, with the internet, social media, mainstream media, commentators and politicians all, wittingly or unwittingly, playing a part in a symphony that swells and amplifies basic tenets of manosphere ideology, resulting in the same aim: spreading fear. Fear of women, fear of feminism, fear of #MeToo, fear of progress, fear of change. For those who oppose advancing equality, it is far more effective to make others terrified of it than it is to oppose it openly using logic or argument. People are motivated by fear. And it is fear of being under attack, of being vulnerable to a threat they hadn’t even realised existed, that makes them most likely to succumb to hate and anger against others. It prevents them from sympathising with those ‘others’, whether they are refugees or women in the workplace, because such support suddenly becomes positioned in direct opposition to their own best interests.

    - ‘Social networking between influencers makes it easy for audience members to be incrementally exposed to, and come to trust, ever more extremist political positions.’

    - far from the ‘dark corners of the internet’, she warned that ‘much extremist content is happening front and centre, easily accessible on platforms like YouTube, publicly endorsed by well-resourced individuals and interfacing directly with mainstream culture’.

    - In 2018, sociologists and former YouTube employees began to speak out about the secretive algorithms that serve up recommended videos to YouTube users, trying to entice them to watch more content after the video they originally viewed has finished. These algorithms might not seem especially important, until you learn that 70 per cent of all YouTube videos watched are recommended by the platform’s algorithm.9 So people spend significantly more time watching the content served up to them than videos they’ve actually gone looking for. Remember that 37 per cent of all mobile internet traffic is accounted for by YouTube? These two statistics combined mean that around a quarter of all mobile internet traffic in the world consists of people watching the videos YouTube has chosen for them to watch–a figure so mind-boggling it takes a minute to sink in. In that context, the sort of content YouTube’s algorithm is directing us to suddenly takes on a whole new significance. Which is bad news when you learn what former YouTube engineer Guillaume Chaslot has to reveal about the algorithm and how it works. Because YouTube makes its money from advertising, its greatest motive is to keep users watching videos for as long as possible, resulting in the greatest possible number of eyeballs to serve adverts to. One major public misconception set straight by Chaslot, when he voiced his concerns to multiple media outlets in 2018, is the assumption that the algorithm seeks to serve people the most relevant or highest-quality content. This, Chaslot says, is definitively not the case. Instead, it focuses entirely on ‘watch time’. And research has shown that what makes people keep watching, and clicking for more, is increasingly extreme content.

    - Writing in the New York Times, sociologist Zeynep Tufekci described how, no matter what ordinary video she started out with, YouTube’s algorithm would quickly send her down a spiralling rabbit hole of associated, but far more hardcore, content. ‘Videos about vegetarianism led to videos about veganism. Videos about jogging led to videos about running ultramarathons.’10 A Wall Street Journal investigation revealed the same phenomenon.11 Of course, for those looking for videos about fun dance moves, say, or cookery techniques, this is a relatively harmless pattern. But, for impressionable young people who start out looking at quite mainstream political content, it has much more serious implications. Chaslot told the Daily Beast he very quickly realised that ‘YouTube’s recommendation was putting people into filter bubbles… There was no way out.’

    - young people are particularly vulnerable to political and ideological exploitation as they start to explore their world and work out where they stand. The men of the manosphere and the alt-right understand this. They realise the opportunity that young, malleable minds present and they are prepared to exploit them to the fullest possible extent.

    - male-supremacist communities are not only directly targeting young men for radicalisation, but also seeing their ideology as a gateway to further white-supremacist radicalisation.

    - The ultimate aim for these groups, rooted in racist and misogynistic extremism, is to move from the internet to the streets, taking their violence and their recruits with them. The internet is seen as the recruiting ground for the physical acts to come.

    - The Prevent guidance describes ‘radicalisation’ as ‘the process by which a person comes to support terrorism and extremist ideologies associated with terrorist groups’. It also refers to the current UK definition of ‘terrorism’, which, as we have already seen, includes reference to ‘an action that endangers or causes serious violence to a person/people’, and ‘must be designed to influence the government or to intimidate the public and is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause’. It is in no way an exaggeration to suggest that these definitions precisely describe the acts of violence and methods of radicalisation deployed by extremist misogynistic groups, such as incels and other factions of the manosphere. But it is very clear that they are nowhere near the government’s radar. They are virtually unheard of, while other forms of extremism are so highly monitored among young people that every teacher in the country is under orders to be on the alert for them.

    - The total lack of awareness about this form of radicalisation, and the enormous impact it may be having on some young people, is a missed opportunity to tackle the problem before it spirals out of control. But it is also a travesty for young men. We are letting down our boys if we don’t acknowledge the deeply damaging and deliberately manipulative messaging they are being targeted with online. We fail them if we don’t give them an opportunity to have open, robust discussions about these issues in a safe forum in which they feel supported and able to express their fears and anxieties. We are leaving them dangling, with no meaningful conversations or factually accurate information at all in the majority of cases, leaving them deeply vulnerable to the circling online sharks. And, of course, the widespread fear-mongering described in the previous chapter drives them straight into the waiting, open arms of internet extremists.

    - The more we underestimate the manosphere, the more we risk serving it our young men on a platter.

    - Emotions are equated with shame, and boys are encouraged to hide them. Isolation breeds longing for community. Shame breeds desperation for prestige, for respect, for a sense of purpose. A sense of vulnerability, arising, in part, from the fact that boys are most at risk of being victims of violent crime, leads naturally to a desire for the security of a group allegiance. All these cravings are gleefully satisfied by manosphere communities, keen to seize upon disenfranchised, angry young men and fill their gaping holes with false promises, skewed logic and hate.

    - Thirty years ago, marginalized, broken, angry young people had to be met face-to-face to get recruited into a movement. Nowadays, those millions and millions of young people are living most of their lives online if they don’t have real-world connections. And they’re finding a community online, instead of in the real world, and having conversations about promoting violence.
