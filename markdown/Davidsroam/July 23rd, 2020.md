- Preparing steps in #[[Storage and Backup]]:
    - [[Lightroom Laptop]]atalog on [[Seagate Expansion Drive]]

    - [[Lightroom Laptop]]c images on [[Seagate Expansion Drive]]:

    - Make room on [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]].
        - Use [[Syncback]] to ensure that there is a complete copy of the **exercise** folder on [[Seagate Bac]].
        - Remove the **exercise** folder from [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]]. This should create enough place to use the drive with [[Lightroom]].
        - There are two image backup folders on [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]]. Steps to be taken:
            - Ensure that the operational image catalog on [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]] is as complete as possible.
            - Back up the operational image catalog.
            - Remove redundant backups.
    - 10:08
        - copying lightroom backup catalogs from [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]] to [[Seagate Expansion Drive]], intend later to delete these from [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]]. Size: 871 GB
        - Next step is to copy [[Lightroom Laptop]]atalog from [[Seagate Expansion Drive]] to [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]]
    - 18:50
        - Now I have copied the larger [[Lightroom]] catalog to [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]] and begun importing from that catalog to a new [[Lightroom]] catalog on the  laptop (**[[Lightroom Desktop]]**). The image files will (hopefully) remain on the [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]].
        - Next, rearrange the image folders to create a rational structure.
        - Next, I should import from the backup catalogs one at a time to **[[Lightroom Desktop]]**, ignoring copies. 
        - After that, I should be able to delete the backup catalogs from the [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]]
    - Backup strategy so far:

- [[Kerstin]] and I drove out to [[Marianne]]s place in [[Simonstorp]] after lunch, but we came home after a while due to the wind.
