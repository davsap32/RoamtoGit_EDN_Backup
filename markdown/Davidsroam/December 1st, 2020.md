    - Received and installed a new NAS from [[Synology]]. Name: SynologyDS218. IP address: 192.168.0.38. I can connect to this device from my [[Ipad]], which makes it possible for me to access video courses and such without needing to store them on the Ipad. #[[Home Tech]]
    - [[Kerstin]] is feeling much better after her cold, but she has decided not to go to [[Arboga]], which she had planned to do tomorrow. [[Marianne]] will go instead, and meet the chimneyseeep to discuss repairs which need to be done on the rood of [[Lizzie]]'s home.
    - [[Erika]] asked if I would be prepared to work more hours for the bank, which would imply signing a new contract with a higher ceiling (75% or 100% compared to 50% as it is now).

    - Watching a masterclass with [[Annie Leibovitz]] on portrait #Photography - quite inspiring.
