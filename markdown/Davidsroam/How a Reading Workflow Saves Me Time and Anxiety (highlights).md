    - As I come across articles during the day, I try not to read them then and there, but instead save them for later using Instapaper. I then typically read them during the hour before I go to sleep. Saving everything this way has the added benefit of producing a searchable archive of everything I’ve read. Also, I don’t tend to do this, but Instapaper allows you to send your saved articles to your distraction-free Kindle.
