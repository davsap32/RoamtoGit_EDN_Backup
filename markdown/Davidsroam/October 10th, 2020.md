    - [[Roam Research]] Installed [[Mark Robertson]]s [[Roam Capture]] shortcut for IOS. [Link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e773398c14164c12bb682135446f2ca4)

        - This enable me to jot down notes and ideas and get them into [[Roam Research]] without much friction.
    - Spending about 15 minutes every day practicing [[Touch Typing]] with [[Typesy]].  This is [[Deliberate practice]] as described in [[Peak_ Secrets from the New Science of Expertise]], as it requires focus and concentration, and performance is being measured.  My best result so far it 98% accuracy and 33 WPM speed. It seems to be extremely difficult to reach 100% accuracy. #Productivity
    - Now that I can sort the rows in an attribute table using [[David Vargas]] javascript plugin, I think that I have a good solution for tracking habits in [[Roam Research]]. I'll do my #Habit-tracker in [[Notion]] and [[Roam Research]] in parallel for a while, and then continue in [[Roam Research]] if no complications turn up. 
    - I have spent some time today extracting #Evergreens from the highlights frim the [[The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less]]. I have highlighted large amounts of text from the book, so there is some work to be done processing the highlights. #Books #[[Digital Garden]] This book together with the one I am reading now, [[The Unfair Advantage]] contain much food for thought for my [[Business Future]] project. #Books

    - [[Shawn Murphy]] has published a tweet about a javascript extension for [[Roam Research]] which enables filtering of [[Attribute Tables]]. [Link](https://gist.github.com/GitMurf/aece9f105628640cb79925d1310449ec) to code on [[GitHub]]. I could filter out the template row by filtering for "202" in the date column. The template row isn't such a big deal but it would be fun to try.

    - Finished listening to the #Podcast with [[Rich Roll]] and [[Michael Gervais]]. I found the discussion about [[Vision]], [[Purpose]] and [[Philosophy]] very interesting. I'd like to read [[Michael Gervais]] book. [Link to the podcast](https://youtu.be/yXmOHP5sBxs).

    - Installed [[Shawn Murphy]]'s [[Attribute Tables]] filter. Now I can remove the row in the [[Habit-tracker]] corresponding to the template by filtering it out using ({not} Date). Summary of [[Shawn Murphy]]'s extension:
