    - Weekly review is a good idea. Something to experiment with. There is a good guide to doing weekly review on [[Anonym.s]] Youtube course. Link at [[Roam Research]]

    - Now I have succeeded in traversing the directories of Readdle Documents on the [[Ipad]] and producing a text file with directory and file contents. The name of the Python script is ^^readdle_booklist_2.py^^. Looking through the output text file, I see that there is no consistency in the file name structure. Many files have <title-author>, but many only have <title> or in some cases <title - more title>, which makes it difficult to use the dash to find out if the author name is included. There are also some cases of <author - title> and <title by author>. 
There are many video files included in the list, these will be easy to filter based on the file extension.
So now I have to decide the best way forward. There are **1245** files in the structure, so that manual methods are not going to work. To be decided. #Booklists

    - While working with my #[[Booklists]] project, I have been looking for a good [[Python]] reference and training guide. The book [[Supercharged Python: Take Your Code to the Next Level]] by [[Brian Overland & John Bennett]] seems to be what I need. [[Books]]

    - Kerstin left this morning for Arboga. She will return tomorrow or the day after.
    - [[Digital Garden]]Still reading [[Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results]]. Lots of sensible advice. I have been highlighting and making notes using my [[Onyx]] and was once able to sync from there to [[OneNote]], but now the [[Onyx]] displays the message that the file name is too long. Alternatives:
        - I may be able to use [[OneNote]] sync for books with shorter titles. So far, I have not seen how to rename books on the [[Onyx]]
        - I can send the notes as a text file using [[Gmail]], but there are problems with character mapping which would in that case need to be solved. Also, this involves leaving the reader and starting the [[Gmail]] app.
        - I can use [[Solid Explorer]] ([[Onyx]] app) to copy/paste the notes file from [[Onyx]] internal storage to the [[Onyx]] folder on [[OneDrive]]. this involves leaving the reader and starting the [[Solid Explorer]] app.
        - I can sync directly from the [[Onyx]] reader app to [[Evernote]]. I have tested this and it works smoothly. I can use Evernote on my browser on the PC and [[Ipad]]. I have also installed the [[Evernote]] app on my [[Ipad]]. Evernote will only allow apps on two devices, so there is the possibility of installing the Evernote app on my PC. The limitation to two app installations would not apply if I were to upgrade my [[Evernote]] account at about {{calc: 43*12}} SEK per year, I am hesitant because I already have [[Roam Research]] [[OneNote]], [[Notion]] and [[Instapaper]] (Although the last three do not cost me any extra money - OneNote is included in my [[Office 365]] subscription). With all of these apps it will be difficult to remember what information is in which app.

    - I have learned how to use [[MySQL workbench]] to manage the contents of my #[[Booklists]] database. My learning curve feels very steep. Next step is to set the contents of the "Media" column to [[Onyx]] for all rows at present in the database. I spent some time trying to connect to the database from a [[MySQL]] client app on the [[Ipad]], but I haven't succeeded so far. More for the challenge of doing it - it's not a function I really need.
- 16:38
    - #[[Booklists]] I used the [[MySQL workbench]] app to set the 'media' field to 'Onyx' for all rows. The next step is to populate the [[booklist database]] with entries from the Goodreads list of books read.
- 17:17
    - #[[Booklists]] I exported a list of books read from [[Goodreads]] in CSV format. I then wrote a [[Python]] script ^^"goodreads list to mysql.py"^^ where i used the [[Python]] CSV module to parse the file and identify author and title per row. I inserted these into the [[booklist database]] and set the 'media' field in each row to 'read'. So now the database includes all read books (556 rows with media='read').
- 18:56
    - I have exported a text file with a list of all books in the [[Calibre]] database, and written a [[Python]] program to parse it based on character position. There is however a problem with new lines created for long titles, so I will try to list as a JSON file and import from there.
- 19:28
    - Now I have imported the calibre booklist to the [[booklist database]] following an export in JSON. 
Calibredb commmand for JSON export: 
**calibredb --library-path=G:\Calibre-library list --for-machine > calibredb.txt**
Python program:  ^^"calibre contents to mysql booklist db.py"^^
- 21:53
    - I have tested sending emails to my [[OneNote]]. Address: me@onenote.com. This works fine. ref:"15:06". Evernote still is the solution with the lowest friction. 
    - I renamed the document file for the [[Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results]] book on [[Onyx]] to make the name shorter. I used the [[Solid Explorer]] app. Now The notes and highlights for this book sync to Onenote. I have bound the [[Onyx]] to both [[OneNote]] and [[Evernote]], the [[Onyx]] now syncs to both of them at the same time. Text formatting seems to work well in both cases. Ref note at "15:06". At the moment I don’t see a need to upgrade my [[Evernote]] account.
- Tomorrow I will populate the [[booklist database]] with the **Readdle documents** titles. I will filter for mp4 files. I cannot think of a way to separate title and author, the entire filename will go into the title field and nothing into the author field. For each document, the ‘media’ field will be set to ‘Readdle’.
