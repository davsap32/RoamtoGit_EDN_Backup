    - According to [[Lukas Kawerau]] ([[Galaxy Brain]] course instructor), important **Concepts**,  **Propositions **and **Questions **should be pages in [[Roam Research]]. So #[[Evergreens]] should be pages. #[[Roam Research]] #[[Digital Garden]]
    - Watching the course lesson "Coherent and Atomic - Writing Reusable Thoughts", I learned to link to blocks so that the block text is not seen until thr mouse pointer hovers over the link. Ctrl-k gives [](), then add extra double parentheses between the curved parentheses. Example: [link](((KkTw7Eoms))). #[[Roam Research]] #[[Digital Garden]]

    - Completed changing all the #[[Evergreens]] to page links. Did some further rearrangement at the same time, also shortened some of the proposition texts, which [[Lukas Kawerau]] thinks should be max 250 characters. #[[Roam Research]] #[[Digital Garden]]
    - I have spent some time tidying, as [[Susanne]] and [[Lennart]] are due to eat dinner with us and probably stay overnight.

    - I installed [[Maggie Appleton]]s [[Leyendecker]] CSS theme from the [Roamcult Themes page](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY). Now I can set styles freely in my Roam pages. #[[Roam Research]] #[[Digital Garden]]
    - I have added tags to all the page links to #Evergreens pages. There were about 150 of them and I couldn't find a method to do "Find and Replace" on them all at the same time, so I had to do it manually. Now that these links are tags, I can use the CSS selector "data-tag" to find them  by selecting tags beginning with "E:" and then setting style as follows:
        - span.rm-page-ref[data-tag^="E:"] {
            - background: #99DD4A !important;
            - color: #fff !important;
            - padding: 3px 7px;
            - line-height: 2em;
            - font-weight: 500;
        - }
        - So now I can mark all the #Evergreens links with their own style. I can do the same with project and area pages if I choose to prefix their names with **P:** and **A:**
