    - I had some #Work tasks to do today and felt an aversion to them. Now they are done, they were not unpleasant in any way. As soon as I started thinking practically about what I needed to do, the aversion evaporated. The aversion is partly due to the fear that it will not be possible for me to perform the tasks well, and that I might be criticized for that. Fear is a potent hinder, and has as much power as I grant it.
    - I have only reported two hours of #Work today, but it feels as if work has dominated my day. This is the disadvantage of part-time work, it expands in awareness to fill other parts of the day than those spent doing it.
