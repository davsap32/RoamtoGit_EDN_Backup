    - I have a long list of podcasts which I want to listen to, I need a podcast app which helps me manage a queue of podcasts.

The [[Onyx]] uses the following to mark notes that I have added to highlights: æ³¨ |. Not a problem really, but I did check that it is doable to replace this with e.g. 'Note:' using search and replace in Word.
