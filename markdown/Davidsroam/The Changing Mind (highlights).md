    - One tangible thing that we can all do to avoid misjudging others is to exercise compassion, to allow for the possibility that you might be wrong in attributing a trait to someone’s behavior.

    - Curiosity, Openness, Associations (as in sociability), Conscientiousness, and Healthy practices are the five lifestyle choices that have the biggest impact on the rest of our lives.

    - From a neurocognitive standpoint, wisdom is the ability to see patterns where others don’t see them, to extract generalized common points from prior experience and use those to make predictions about what is likely to happen next. Oldsters aren’t as fast, perhaps, at mental calculations and retrieving names, but they are much better and faster at seeing the big picture. And that comes down to decades of generalization and abstraction.

    - The key to remembering things is to get involved in them actively. Passively learning something, such as listening in a lecture, is a sure way to forget it. Actively using information, generating and regenerating it, engages more areas of the brain than merely listening, and this is a sure way to remember it.

    - We tend to remember best those things that we pay the most attention to. And the deeper we pay attention, the more likely those things are to form robust memories in our brains.

    - Fish oil provides the omega-3 fatty acids that the body uses to create myelin, and it can even repair damaged myelin caused by traumatic brain injury.

    - We experience different modes of attention throughout the day. Two of the most noticeable are what neuroscientists call the central executive mode and the default, or resting-state mode. In the central executive mode we are focused, we direct our thoughts and filter our distractions. In the resting-state mode, our thoughts meander, they are loosely connected, and this has led to its being called the “daydreaming mode” of the brain. The daydreaming mode is restorative after you’ve been focusing on something intensely for a while, and it is often the mode during which you can effectively solve problems.

    - One of the most protective things you can do against aging is to learn a manual skill when you’re young and keep it up. The next best thing you can do is to start learning something new when you’re old.

    - The efficiency with which we learn new motor skills, however, declines with age—we can learn well into our nineties and beyond, but the learning takes more concentration and more time.

    - The wisdom that we find in older adults—the most experienced members of our population—follows from these four specific things: associations, experience, pattern recognition, and the use of analogies. And this is why we gain more and more wisdom as we age. Wisdom comes from the accumulated set of things we’ve seen and experienced, our ability to detect patterns in those experiences, and our ability to predict future outcomes based on them. 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - Making associations underpins learning. To assimilate new information we need to associate it with what we’ve seen before. Life experience gives us more associations to make, more patterns to recognize. 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - the best strategy for cognitive health is to keep doing new things—things that require new ways of thinking.

    - The number to remember is 1/25th of a second, which is the annual decrement in reaction time that we found in participants between the ages of 30 and 71 years. This value doesn’t seem very much, but after 30–40 years, such slowing can be the cause of broken hips and mental slips.

    - (Once we are past the age of reproducing and passing our genes to the next generation, evolution doesn’t care about how we spend the rest of our lives.) 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - wisdom arises from four things: associations, experience, pattern recognition, and the use of analogies. And this is why we gain more and more wisdom as we age. Older people have more wisdom precisely because of how the brain’s networks have evolved to scaffold on prior knowledge and experience, to abstract out common principles, to be able to see to the core of a matter that might elude younger (and less wise) observers, and to have more experiences on which to base analogies. 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - the internal resources that predict the development of wisdom include: mastery (managing uncertainty and uncontrollability), openness, reflectivity, and emotion regulation, including empathy 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - Other people, such as friends and mentors, play a crucial role in both the short-term expression and the long-term development of wisdom. Situational contexts, including life phases, also influence the extent to which people act on their wisdom-related knowledge. 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - The wisdom we attribute to older adults may well be neurobiologically based, born out of changes to the brain that allow the two hemispheres to communicate more freely, to combine the logical with the intuitive, the quantitative with the qualitative, the fact-based thinking with the artistic. Greater wisdom is also marked by freer connections between the frontal lobes and the much older limbic system, and by age-related changes in neurochemistry.50 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - Wisdom comes from combining motivational, emotional, and cognitive experiences, having successfully overcome challenges, and having had meaningful interactions with others. Although we may think of wisdom as primarily an intellectual quality, in fact it is heavily reliant on emotional maturity and a shift in those motivations that drive us. Emotion and motivation change with age as a function of a number of different hormonal and neurotransmitter changes in the brain. 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - Precursors of wisdom, such as empathy, emotion regulation, and critical thinking, can be modeled and explicitly taught from an early age.52

    - Emotions are an acute state of affect and arousal lasting from seconds to minutes, whereas mood refers to a longer-term emotional tone. Emotions occur against a background of mood.3 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - Emotions evolved because they motivate us. They are that surge of something (arousal) you feel welling up in you that makes you want to take some kind of action. They move us away from danger and toward food, dry shelter, and potential mates: key elements that positively reinforce our identities. It is no accident that the word motion is contained in the word emotion. Nor is it a coincidence that when we are feeling particularly deep emotion, we say we are moved. Emotions are the body’s way of encouraging us to do what is best for us, 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - What we call emotions or feelings occur when we consciously detect that a survival or motivational brain circuit is active or we detect some change in body state, and then—here’s the amazing part—our consciousness appraises and labels this state.9 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - when it comes to the emotional interpretation of events, your brain is making not predictions but superfast “postdictions,” after-the-fact inferences about things that have already happened. Your brain is continually rewriting your perceptual history to conform to new incoming facts. This is a form of Bayesian inferencing: form an opinion and update that opinion as new information becomes available.

    - Someone who has grown up in adverse conditions will have long-term memories that contain threatening and stressful information; their default prediction for even neutral events is that something bad could happen, and this kicks in their stress response, releasing cortisol and adrenaline in advance of a great many situations that are benign.

    - not everyone with a stressful childhood ends up with a psychiatric disorder, or even a high allostatic load. Stressful experiences can lead to very different outcomes, depending on the interaction of the factors listed above. Some people develop resilience, grit, tenacity, and focus. Others fall apart. The prized combination that allows some people to live more positive lives, to turn lemons into lemonade, is still unknown and an active topic of research.

    - Reducing stress and increasing resilience, the ability to bounce back from adversity, can be coached and taught through specialized psychotherapy, strengthening of social networks, physical exercise, and programs that help people find meaningful and purposeful activities in their lives.31 But that can take some effort (and openness to new experiences).

    - The way that we cope with setbacks and adversity is largely influenced by the combination of genes, culture, and environment. A genetic predisposition toward resilience and optimism can lead to different coping styles and outcomes than one toward fatalism and pessimism. In general, children learn to react to the world by modeling their parents. Parents who have strategies for dealing with unpleasant or traumatic events will display those to their children, and their children are likely to imitate them.

    - There are countless ways to reach bodhi, or what Western cognitive psychologists call the flow state. As you might imagine, it involves that daydreaming network I wrote about earlier (see page 79), the brain’s default mode. Very few people live in this state of egolessness. Some claim to, egotistically, and they say that they’ll teach you to do it too for a large sum of money. If you’re interested in this state, look for a reluctant guru, someone who doesn’t have an inflated sense of themselves as a great teacher.

    - Much of our motivation to do things is controlled by our brains and by the hormones and neurochemicals circulating within. (Hormones are a kind of neurochemical that works both inside the central nervous system and outside of it.) We tend to think that our motivation and desire to do things are driven by our own ideas, our will. We decide to go out for a brisk walk and then we do it. But the hormones are the hidden strings that pull our bodies.

    - Immersing yourself fully in whatever activities you engage in—work, leisure, family, community—is protective against cognitive decline and physical illness. The rewards from doing things that please you lift your mood, and strengthen the immune system, increasing the production of cytokines, T-cells, and immunoglobulin A. 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - People who focus mainly on getting recognition for their achievements are far less likely to seek challenges and less likely to persist in learning than those who focus on the learning itself.74 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - People with a fixed mind-set generally have an external locus of control. They are low in Curiosity and Openness. They aren’t interested in learning new things and don’t think that the payoff of learning new things will be worth the effort. People with a growth mind-set believe that they can change their skill sets, that they can continue to learn. They have an internal locus of control and believe that effort is sometimes its own reward and that it can yield big dividends. Hard work can be enjoyable. People with a growth mind-set are energized by learning and invigorated when they succeed at something that was previously difficult. To them, life is a journey of gathering new information, meeting new people, seeking helpful feedback from mentors or teachers, and learning new skills. People of all ages with a growth mind-set outperform people with a fixed mind-set.

    - As we age, our motivations to be recognized for our achievements, and to rack up more and more achievements, tend to decline—that is, older adults tend toward being more intrinsically than extrinsically motivated. Older adults show increases in their motivation to use their accumulated knowledge, to help others, to preserve their resources, and to maintain a sense of autonomy and competence.79

    - Loneliness is associated with early mortality.2 It has been implicated in just about every medical problem you can think of, including cardiovascular incidents, personality disorders, psychoses, and cognitive decline. Loneliness can double the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease. It increases the production of stress hormones, which in turn lead to arthritis and diabetes, dementia, and increased suicide attempts. It leads to inflammation, increasing proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), and it negates the beneficial effects of exercise on neurogenesis, the growth of new neurons.3, 4 Loneliness is worse for your health than smoking fifteen cigarettes a day.5 If you are chronically lonely, the risk that you will die in the next seven years goes up by 30 percent.6

    - People can feel lonely even when surrounded by others, such as in the middle of a party or inside a large family. Loneliness is a feeling of being detached from meaningful relationships, and that may arise from feeling unacknowledged, from feeling misunderstood, or from a lack of intimacy. Having a spouse sometimes helps, and sometimes not. There are certainly people who enjoy being alone and who do not feel lonely, just as there are people who are constantly in the presence of others, perhaps making small talk, but feeling completely alone. Being unmarried raises the risk of loneliness and a host of health-related problems, but being married doesn’t help in all cases—not all marriages are happy ones.

    - religious people feel happier because religion promotes gratitude through prayers and gives them a social network, along with a sense of purpose and meaning—three things that benefit most of us, regardless of where they come from. Those social benefits appear also to accrue in the nonreligious who join a music listening group, volunteer in a soup kitchen, or have block parties with their neighbors.39

    - As the British children’s laureate Sir Michael Morpurgo writes,43 It is the need of every single one of us, child or grown-up, to feel wanted, to feel we belong and that we matter to someone else in the world. We all know, from our own experience, that feeling isolated from those around us, alienated from society, makes us sad, even angry. The deeper this isolation becomes, the more hurtful and resentful we feel and the more this is reflected in our behavior. Such behavior only leads to greater alienation. Children who from an early age feel alone and apart from the rest of the world, and there are so many of them, who become angry and hurt, have little chance of leading fulfilled lives. They are lost from the start. Above all, they need friendship, the solid warmth of someone who cares and goes on caring. With such lasting friendship, self worth and self confidence can flourish, and a child’s life can be altered forever.

    - When time is limited, goals related to deriving emotional meaning from life are prioritized over goals that maximize long-term payoffs in a shortened future.

    - Middle-aged adults tend to direct their energy toward bringing their environment in line with their own wishes—they renovate and build houses, for example, and do other things to mold their world to their liking. Older adults typically focus on changing themselves to accord with their environment. To meet the challenges of aging, older individuals increasingly need to resort to strategies of adjusting expectations and activities in order to pursue more attainable goals when the kinds of activities that characterized their youth become more difficult to do.

    - increasing age, in many cases, is associated with better emotional balance.48 Part of this balance may be owing to deactivations of the amygdala—we are less likely to experience negative thoughts as we age, and less likely to be fearful.49 The amygdala is responsible for detecting and responding to threats, and these can result in the secretion of chemicals throughout the brain (norepinephrine, acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin) and body (hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol).

    - The higher people’s sense of self-efficacy, the higher the goals they set for themselves. A sense of control is a basic necessity of psychological life. Individuals who perceive that they lack control over their environments may seek to gain control in any way possible, potentially acting out, breaking the law, lashing out at loved ones, or developing eating disorders.

    - The emerging picture is clear. When people retire, they tend to turn in on themselves. Then cognitive decline and mood disturbances can take hold. This is not true for everyone, but it is true for a great many. And as depression seeps in, at first unnoticed, it comes on so gradually that we don’t do anything about it while we still have our wits about us and our will to change. Later, someone close to us notices the change in our demeanor, our spark, and it becomes an uphill battle to try to fix it. Retirement from most jobs means a rapid shrinking of the number of people we come into contact with, and the sense that we are engaged in meaningful work.

    - Aging has beneficial effects on our social behavior. Older adults in general (I know you can probably think of exceptions) are better at emotional regulation; they are better able to control their feelings, are less reactive to insults, and pay more attention to the positive things in their lives.58 
        - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
    - Art Shimamura describes it this way:59 One explanation for this maturity is that through decades of social interactions, older adults have confronted the good, bad, and ugly of how people deal with one another. As such, they better understand that choices can be made concerning how we behave and how healthy living is best achieved by focusing on the positive side of life. This positivity bias adheres to the saying, don’t sweat the small stuff, and is important for psychological well-being as life is too short to worry about minor annoyances.

    - At any given time, 30 percent of the population is experiencing chronic pain—which means they’ve been in pain and they’ve had that pain for more than three months.4 For older adults the number is closer to 40 or 50 percent. The odds of experiencing chronic pain at some point in your life are one in two. More people are in chronic pain at this minute than have cancer, heart disease, or diabetes combined.

    - Meditation involves maintaining attention on your immediate experience in the moment and in the world, and away from distractions such as self-referential thinking and mind wandering. It helps to train you to avoid thinking about something other than what you’re currently doing, taming the default mode network that I mentioned earlier. Meditation reduces activity within the default mode network and increases connectivity between it and regions of the brain that are implicated in cognitive control—that is, controlling our thoughts: the dorsal anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices.87 The result is that meditation simultaneously turns down the default mode’s pull on our attention, while streamlining and honing the network. Increased connectivity between the prefrontal region and the default areas also has an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing cytokines.88

    - The single most important factor in determining successful aging is the personality trait of Conscientiousness. Conscientiousness is associated with a great number of positive outcomes in life.
