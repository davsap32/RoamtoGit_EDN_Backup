    - Still feeling hip pain - it disturbed my sleep last night, so I took an Ipren, which seemed to help. #Illness
    - By trial and error, I found the css block that controls the appearance of the caption which is displayed when hovering over a bullet with the mouse. The text cannot be seen when the block is activated. [[Roam Research]]

        - I have deactivated the block and will see if this creates any problems.

        - My wifi network is now working well, I use SSID HOME54 for 2.4 Ghz and SSID HOME54_5G for 5Ghz, the same on each of my three routers. My Ipad connects to the router with the best signal as I move around the house. I can check on this using the [[Network analyzer pro]] app, in which the information page displays the make (vendor) of the router I am connected to. The BSSID shown in [[Network analyzer pro]] corresponds to the MAC adress of the router. The 5 Ghz network performance is much better comapred to the 2.4 Ghz. #[[Home Tech]]
        - [[Kerstin]]will fetch [[Leo]] and [[Alice]] and bring them here to work on their Christmas present projects. [[Josefine]]and [[Ellen]] will then come for supper.
        - We have invited [[Carl-Otto]] and [[Cecilia]] to eat lunch with us on [[December 19th, 2020]]. We will eat outside by our fireplace in the forest.
        - Started reading [[The Changing Mind]], finding it interesting. #Books
