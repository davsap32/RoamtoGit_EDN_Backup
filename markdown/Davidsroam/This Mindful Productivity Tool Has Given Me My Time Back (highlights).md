    - Monitoring my time with Be Focused
There are a bunch of pomodoro timer apps out there and many of them work well for staying on the 25 minute â€” 5 minute schedule. However, I was looking for more than just a timer. I wanted data. I needed a clear-cut way to to monitor how much time I spent on each task.

Be Focused is a simple app that provides just that. It allows you to define clear tasks, set the timing of work and break intervals, manage daily goals, and use these data to track your work patterns and progress over time.

My tasks are simple:

writing
R / data analysis
shallow work (e.g. email, calendar, appointments, etc)
reading

My goals are even simpler:

complete 6 intervals a day
write more than I do any other task
minimize amount of time spent on shallow work
