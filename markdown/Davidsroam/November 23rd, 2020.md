    - [[Kerstin]] mentioned yesterday that she was satisfied with having purchased most of the Christmas presents for the family. I shrugged, showing lack of interest, upon which [[Kerstin]] felt underappreciated. She was proud of having taken care of this well in advance, and felt that I should acknowledge and appreciate that. This is an old issue between us - Christmas is not important to me and I involve myself in questions of decoration, presents, food etc to the minimum extent possible. Kerstin is not happy with this, as Christmas is important to her. Due to my childhood in which I experienced our family (Jewish) traditions and my forced participation as something to free myself from, I still experience aversion toward this type of event.
