    - Many meetings today at #Work - feels more meaningful than previously, my contribution is clearer, att least to myself.
    - Still not ready to resume winter bathing  - I am feeling better but not completely free from infection #Illness
    - Not sure what to buy for [[Kerstin]] as a Christmas present - the ideas I had until now are not good enough. I have asked her to write a wishlist.
    - Struggling a bit with [[On the Plain of Snakes]], about 2/3 of the way through I feel that I know enough about [[Paul Theroux]]â€™s trip to Mexico.
