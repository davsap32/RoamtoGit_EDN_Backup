    - I made a shopping list in [[Evernote]] yesterday and used it while shopping. As the list was open on my [[Ipad]] while I was  updating it on my [[Iphone]], Evernote messed up the synchronisation. My conclusion is that [[Evernote]] cannot reliably be used in this way. I tried the same thing in [[Simplenote]], the synch goes in both directions and starts on its own rather quickly.  So I'll use [[Simplenote]] for this purpose. #[[Home Tech]]

    - Reading [[The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less]]. The author's argument is quite convincing, that there is always potential to do less of low value activities and more of high value activities. Outside of a business context the assessment of value will have to be subjective, i. e. experienced value. It might be an interesting exercise to list activities and experienced value on say a three level scale.  I have been thinking through how I use my time for some years, so the results of the exercise should not surprise me. Although you can never be sure. One thing that the author says which I find especially interesting is that time is not in practice a limited resource due the fact that most of our time is spent on low value activities. This feels quite counterintuitive for me. I have to see what the experienced value exercise gives. #Books #Productivity
