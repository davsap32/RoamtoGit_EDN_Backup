    - NEW #roamcult EXTENSION: Sorting Attribute Tables!

Installing the extension will add sort icons to each column of the attribute table. Clicking will toggle the column between Neutral, Ascending, and Descending. Could even sort by multiple columns! https://t.co/zkDZsu4zlW 
        - **Note**: Thread
    - The sort will try to sort by date, then numerically, then alphabetically.
