    - Meetings with UK postponed today, Ray had to take leave. Had a good discussion with [[Peter]], [[Erika]] and [[Judith]] about the way forward concerning service provision to UK. ISDM will have to play a larger coordinating role, we need more staff to be able to do this. To be discussed at a meeting with [[Magnus]] and [[Tine]] next week
    - From the recording with [[Wayne Liqourman]] that I am listening to: Everything that any spiritual teacher has ever said is wrong. Whatever was said were pointers specific to a time, place and audience.

    - Went [[bathing]]. Sunny, pleasant weather, 14 C in the air.
    - Following the dramatic developments as USA votes are being counted.
    - Next PT: [[November 8th, 2020]]
    - Spent some time this afternoon on correspondence concerning the CHAPS remediation activities.

    - [[Kerstin]] has returned from Arboga. 
    - Spoke with [[Samuel]] - he has still not been able to retrieve his computers from SA customs, at least partly due to misses on the part of DHL. His colleague in [[Cape Town]], Henry, will have to sort it out next week.
