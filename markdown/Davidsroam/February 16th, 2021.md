    - Called [[Åby Vårdcentral]] to book an appointment to check the yellow patch under my eye. The nurse I spoke to made a note about it and will send it to [[Sara Seaton]] - who will possibly book an appointment with me or not. There was some talk of combining this with a checkup of my asthma situation, which has not been done. I was less than satisfied with the conversation, which seemed to be focused on not giving me access to the doctor if that could be avoided.
    - On [[Twitter]], found a [link](https://github.com/abhayprasanna/abhayprasanna.github.io/tree/master/kanban%20agenda) to an agenda template which seems to be worth trying. [[Roam Research]]
    - Sent an email to the Norrköping Drottninggatan branch of [[SHB]], asking to move to that branch from Gärdet.
    - Called to congratulate [[Lizzie]] on her 95th birthday.

    - [[Kenneth]] called - they have very cold weather in Houston, -10C and lower. There are power cuts all over town. Ken moved to a friends house where there was power, but the power was cut there as well.
        - [[Kenneth]] recommended that I do some standard blood tests, before getting an operation, he believes that there may be a connection between [[BPH]], bladder stones and a yellow discoloration under my eye. I will ask [[Urologist Bengt Folkestad]] about this when I see him on Monday.
