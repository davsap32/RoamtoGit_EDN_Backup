The various forms appearing in life can’t be the reality, because all of them are changing; they’re nothing more than false appearances. If we watch a cloud and it takes on the shape of a person, a house, or a mountain, it doesn’t matter what it looks like, we always know it’s a cloud. (http://darrylbailey.net/awakening)
    - REALIZATION
Even the most extreme spiritual statements are easy to understand. Phrases such as “there is no self,” or “there is only God,” are very simple descriptions of your ordinary, everyday life. Understanding these statements does not require blind belief or new learning or thirty years to achieve.(http://darrylbailey.net/realization)
The hope for spiritual enlightenment is usually the hope of avoiding what we are, the hope of avoiding the pains and confusions of existence, but enlightenment is the realization we can't avoid them… Spiritual liberation frees you from the misery-inducing fantasy of perfecting yourself. In this moment, I am what I am; you are what you are; we’re both the dance of the cosmos. Liberation isn’t the act of breaking free of this. Liberation is knowing it can’t be otherwise.
