    - Sitting on the train to stm, listening to a #Podcast with [[Max Tegmark]] and [[Lex Fridman]]. [[Max Tegmark]] points out that goal-oriented analysis is much more rewarding than risk-oriented analysis. He talks about [[AGI]] (Artificial General Intelligence)as something that might save us from many potential catastrophes threatening life on earth. Also as an enabler for space exploration. #Reflections. #Inbox

    - Sitting at [[Torsgatan]] in Stm, waiting for my meeting at 13:00. Also waiting for my [[SHB]] pc to upgrade. I have more or less decided to buy a matress to [[Furusundsgatan 14]]. When we were last there, I checked on the size of the bed. I made a note of it, I am pretty certain it was 200 * 160. I’d like to see the note, but I can’t find it. I have so many places to write notes: 
        - IOS notes
        - Onenote
        - Evernote
        - Simplenote
        - Drafts
        - Roam
    - I need to decide where I am going to save quick notes. Hypothesis is [[Simplenote]] . From there to [[Roam Research]].

    - Returned from Stm. I went out for a beer with [[Erika]] and [[Peter]] after our meeting at [[Torsgatan]] - it was nice meeting them in person again after  having met via video for six months.  We went to [[Pressklubben]] on Vasagatan, seems to be a nice place. [[Erika]] says they have very good food.
    - I updated Win 10 on my [[SHB]] computer, which is something that had to be done in the bank's network.
    - I have had good use of my [[Airpod Pros]] on the journey - they are small to carry, comfortable and functionally excellent. 
    - I spoke with [[Samuel]] on the phone, he is a home feeling ill. My impression is that he is stressing too much and needs to slow down, which I said to him. I got the impression that he realised I was right.
    - I stopped by at [[Samuel]] on the way home to pick up an office chair that [[Josefine]] had saved for me from her work, which no longer needed it. The one I have been using squeeks loudly when I move, which is not popular in video meetings.
    - I watched a video by [[Dalton Mabery]] in which he shows how he takes notes from articles on Internet sites. He mentioned an app called [[Eloquent]] which allows for highlighting while browsing the web. I have installed it and tried it - it seems to fit well in my own workflow. The article he used for his demonstration was from the site [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/) which seems to be very interesting within the area of learning  and knowledge management. I have subscribed to their newsletter. They have published a series of books titles [[The Great Mental Models]] which seem interesting.
