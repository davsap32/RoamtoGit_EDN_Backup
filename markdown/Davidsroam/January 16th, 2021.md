    - I have been unable to use my [[Sony]] headphones on some occasions, the battery being dead in spite of the fact that the headphones were left to charge. It seems that the USB-C cable that I have been using to charge them does not work to charge those headphones. They charge ok with another cable. #[[Home Tech]]
