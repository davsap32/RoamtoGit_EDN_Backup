    - [[Lennart]] and [[Susanne]] arrived  yesterday evening, they ate dinner with us and stayed over. This morning we all went #bathing  - 15 C in the water and 16 C in the air. They ate lunch with us and have recently left for Gothenburg.
    - We were going to cancel our Sunday evening dinner with the family as [[Leo]] had a fever, but [[Samuel]] now says that he seems to be well and they want to come. So now they will come.

    - Now at last the house is empty - [[Kerstin]] has taken [[Amanda]] back to town, and [[Samuel]] and family have gone home. It was all a little too much after having spent most of the day with [[Lennart]] and [[Susanne]]. This evening I was not really in the mood for playing with the grandchildren.  As usual, [[Josefine]] was glued to her telephone. [[Ellen]] was her usual whirlwind and [[Leo]] complained constantly about not having anythng to do, as he missed his Ipad.
