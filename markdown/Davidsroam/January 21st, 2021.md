    - At my first meeting with [[Kenneth Brinck]] in his new role as head of [[CTOS]] he mentioned that he wanted to recruit an employee to CTOS to replace me during the first half year. Based on that, I feel that it is highly unlikely that the bank will renew my contract past 30/6. [[SHB]].

    - It feels as if the medicines I am taking to alleviate [[BPH]] are having effect - after only two days, it has become easier to urinate. I still need to urinate often, probably because the swollen prostate is pressing on my bladder, reducing its capacity. #Illness
    - Went for a walk in the forest with [[Kerstin]]. Very slushy and slippery, you have to be careful.
    - level of discomfort due to [[lower back pain]] & [[Sciatica]]: #Illness
