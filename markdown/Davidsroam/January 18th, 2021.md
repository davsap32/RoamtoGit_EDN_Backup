    - We spoke with the family yesterday evening about travelling together to Gran Canaria to celebrate [[Kerstin]]’s birthday. Everyone was very keen. Today we were prepared to male bookings, but for some reason the price for [[Samuel]]’s family was double compared to what we saw yesterday. We may have too look for alternatives. I have also suggested that we pay 30 kkr for Samuel and family, they pay the rest. Samuel will look at alternatives. #Journeys
