    - Planning meeting with UK at #Work - we have great difficulty in getting service owners to approve their service descriptions. Services include functionality from many areas and it is difficullt to map responsibility for a service onto a line manager responsibility.
    - I have added some texts to [[Typesy]] in order to practice [[Touch Typing]] on texts which feel relevant to me. There is a bug in [[Typesy]] which causes the texts I have saved not to be listed, I have reported the bug. When I do change to a new text my typing skills drop from about 37 wpm with 96% accuracy to under 30 wpm with 90% accuracy. So I still have a way to wander in my practice.
    - I was feeling a bit out of sorts earlier today, after having lain awake for some time during the night. But #bathing in cold water fixed that.
    - I have taped a rope handle on one of two new matresses that I will use at [[Furusundsgatan 14]]. I'll take it with me when I go to Stockhom tomorrow evening.
