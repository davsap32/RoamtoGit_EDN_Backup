    - Finished reading [[The Cult of Trump]]. As is true for many American non-fiction books, it had made its point about half way through, the rest was mainly repetition or unnecessary detail. I skimmed most of the second half of the book. Still, well worth reading.
    - Started reading [[Hitler Downfall 1939-1945]].
