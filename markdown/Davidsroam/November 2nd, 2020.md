    - Spoke with [[Esther]] - [[Samuel]] is on the way to [[Cape Town]]. He arrived too early at Link√∂pings airport this morning and had to wait in a garage for an hour. He should arrive in [[Cape Town]] late this evening.
    - Today I received a formal offer from [[ITC]] to extend my contract with [[SHB]] through June 2021. I accepted the offer. 
    - Started reading [[Who they was]] by [[Gabriel Krauze]]. Very good, about life in rough areas of London.
