    - Read an interesting article on [[Medium]] by [[Charles King]], about Zombies in Haiti, and about religious beliefs and practices. The author of the article has written a book titled [[Gods of the upper air]] which may be worth reading. The author refers to the work of an anthropologist [[Zora Neale Hurston]] who studied the phenomenon of Zombies in Haiti. She wrote a novel titled [[Their Eyes Were Watching God]] which also seems interesting. [Link](https://zora.medium.com/when-zora-met-zombie-dbcf0fb45d11) to the article.  #Philosophy #Books

        - [[Erika]] wants to know whether I will sign on for another six months with [[SHB]]. #Work
            - Arguments to extend:
                - Will I use the time well that I do not spend working for [[SHB]]?
                - If [[Riscom]] is not earning money, can I continue to have Riscom bear costs such as telephone, Internet, tech purchases etc?
                - Do I really believe that I wish to and can develop a new service offering for new customers and in that way continue operating [[Riscom]]? It will be difficult to find a customer as willing as [[SHB]] to provide me with assignments.
                - Each extra month I work for [[SHB]] will add to my savings to be used at a future time, when my retirement savings have been depleted.
            - Arguments not to extend:
                - Working for [[SHB]] is not friction-free. It requires much effort for little progess. [[SHB]] faces major challenges in maturing as a service provider.
                - I don't find my tasks at [[SHB]] stimulating.
                - Having committments to [[SHB]] would prevent me from travelling for extended periods. Although at the moment, the pandemic will prevent me from travelling for extended periods, for as much as another year.
                - I do not want to risk infection by travelling on public transport to Stockholm. However, I think that my wish not to travel will be respeted by  my colleagues.
            - This has been a useful exercise. My conclusion of the above is that I should agree to another six months. I have informed [[Erika]].

        - #Quotes from [[Joan Tollifson]] #Philosophy
            - Being awake is not an intellectual pursuit. It is not about getting the right ideas and figuring everything out. It is not a matter of belief. Nor is it about having extraordinary experiences or altered states of consciousness, or trying to be a good person and do good things. There is nothing other-worldly about it. Being awake is not about seeing angels, having visions, leaving your everyday life far behind, or losing all sense of your unique individuality and being unable to function in everyday life.
            - It’s about what is most simple, most obvious, most ordinary and at the same time, most extraordinary. It is about being liberated on the spot and being awake here and now.
            - Being awake does not depend on any outward circumstances, such as a quiet setting or being in some special meditation posture. It is always already the case. And yet, because consciousness becomes easily hypnotized by its own creations—ideas, concepts, beliefs and stories—and especially by the central illusion or mirage of “me” as a separate, independent, persisting somebody existing in a substantial, observer-independent world “out there”—it can SEEM that “I” am a lost soul trying desperately to figure everything out and get somewhere. And much of our human activity comes out of this delusion, the sense of being separate, and is thus motived by fear, greed, anger, hatred, resentment and so on. And so, spiritual practices evolve naturally as ways of waking up from this delusion and suffering. They are movements of the totality.
            - The one we imagine would be the “doer” of any such awakening practice doesn’t actually exist. And yet, there IS a response-ability, a power to act, that is right here, right now. It is not the separate self or the thinking mind, but rather, our natural intelligence, awareness itself, the totality moving through us. Does it always triumph over delusion? No. Sometimes the force of compulsive habit is too strong and we act out of delusion. But that natural intelligence and aware presence can be discovered and (in some sense) cultivated.
            - In its most intelligent and direct forms, spiritual practice is a pathless path from Here to Here, going nowhere. It is an open exploration and enjoyment of the living actuality here and now.
            - Notice what’s actually showing up. Tune into the sensory-energetic textures, the felt-actuality of experiencing itself (sounds, somatic sensations, tinglings in the body, visual shapes, colors and movements), prior to all the labels, definitions and stories about what is showing up. Be aware of the present-ness of what appears, the undeniable presence of it.
            - Notice the simple fact of being undeniably present and aware. If there is a thought-sense that “you” are a subject “looking out” at the world, see if that “you” can actually be found. Is it really “in” there somewhere, or “back there” somewhere? Is there an actual boundary between “inside you” and “outside you” that can be found? Isn’t this separate and encapsulated “you” simply a kind of mirage created by ever-changing sensations, thoughts, ideas, mental images, visual images, memories, stories, and so on?
            - Feel the openness of aware presence, the way it has room for everything but clings to nothing. Feel that you ARE this openness, that “you” are not encapsulated inside a bodymind, but rather, that the bodymind and the experience of being an apparent person appear and disappear within this limitless vastness, as does the whole universe. You are at once being and beholding it all.
            - Without thinking, does this undeniable awaring presence Here-Now have a name? A gender? An age? A race, ethnicity or nationality? A political leaning? A life story? Or is it empty of all form and all identity? Many apparent forms are showing up—that cannot be denied—but by looking closely, we can SEE that the forms never hold still, that nothing ever resolves or coalesces into any persisting, definable “thing” that can be separated out from the whole. It may SEEM to do so. We can’t deny the appearance of chairs and tables, dogs and cats, you and me, all of which SEEM to be solid, separate, persisting things. But the more closely we look—with physics, or with meditation, or with the eye of an artist—the more we find that these apparently persisting forms are moving and changing, that they are inseparable from the whole, and that they are not solid or substantial. And yet, they can’t be denied either. They’re not nothing. But we can’t actually pin down or grasp what anything is or separate it out from the totality. Nothing holds still except presence itself (Here-Now), the common factor in every different experience.
            - In simply being here, awake and aware, without thought, we are discovering an alive emptiness that is boundless and seamless, empty of all definition, no-thing at all and yet not nothing—a vast presence with ever-unfolding subtlety and richness, appearing as everything we see, feel, taste, touch and experience.
            - And then, we can simply notice how thought comes in—how the mind begins to churn out questions and doubts, how the story-telling begins, the figuring-out, the comparing, the seeking, the resisting, the judging and evaluating. Notice how the “me” shows up, as the subject of a thought or as a mental image, and how our sense of what we are shrinks down from that vast impersonal presence to the capsule-identity of “me,” a particular person, a wave on the ocean of life. Notice how emotions arise and what keeps them going. What if we explore physical pain or unwanted emotions as sensations and energy in the body, without the labels or the storylines? Are pain or difficult emotions really the monsters we thought they were? Are they unbearable? Will they actually kill us, or do they turn out to be nothing of substance—maybe even interesting?
            - If we look closely, we can never find an exact place where any particular wave in the ocean begins or ends, nor can we find any actual boundary between one wave and another, or between a wave and the ocean itself. The wave is never anything other than the ocean. It never holds still or persists as anything in particular. There’s nothing wrong with being a wave, but when we forget that we are the ocean, and that the wave is never really a separate, independent “thing” that can get lost or go astray, we begin worrying about all kinds of flat earth questions: What will happen to “me” after death, and how do “I” compare to the other waves, have “I” fully attained or realized the ocean yet? We begin trying to figure out the nature of water: “What IS it?” we ask.
            - We want to nail it down once and for all. Is it mind or matter, consciousness or primordial awareness, this or that? But the totality cannot be seen as an object in the way we can see an ocean. We cannot stand outside of unicity and grasp it in any way. To do so would be like the eye trying to see itself, the sword trying to cut itself, or fire trying to burn itself. We cannot measure or analyze unicity in the way we can measure and analyze oceans and water.
            - We can give the totality various names (unicity, God, the universe, presence, awareness, Consciousness, the Tao, emptiness, the Self), but if we try to pin down what any of these words refer to as any particular experience, state of mind, substance or entity, we are limiting and objectifying what is limitless and ungraspable. We can never know (as intellectual knowledge) what this whole thing is.
            - And yet, at the same time, we DO know it directly and intimately, in exactly the same way we know water when we drink, touch or swim in it. And we cannot possibly fail to BE this totality. EVERYTHING we see, feel, touch, and experience is nothing other than this. We can never REALLY be lost. Nothing actually stands apart to be lost or bound.
            - But we CAN notice how we IDENTIFY as a particular wave, how we FEEL separate and IMAGINE ourselves independent and in control, how we defend our identities as this type of wave or that type of wave, how we become hypnotized by stories of victimization and entitlement, how we compare ourselves to other waves and feel alternately superior or inferior, how we SEEM to be lost or bound, how we seek the ocean as if it were something mysterious and far away, and how all of this drama and personal identity is both amazingly seductive and yet incredibly painful. We’re never really separate or bound—the problem is always imaginary, but we can certainly FEEL very separate and lost. And while Hitler and Ramana Maharshi were both equally waves on the ocean of unicity, we can SEE that Hitler was acting out of delusion and the sense of separation, while Ramana was acting out of the realization and embodiment of wholeness. Hitler was in a kind of trance; Ramana was awake.
            - So, on the one hand, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do. EVERYTHING is the one reality doing what it does, ALL of it an indivisible movement that cannot in this moment be other than exactly how it is. AND, at the same time, as part of that indivisible movement, there IS something to do! We can’t land on either side. Both are true, and both are important. There is a natural desire to wake up, to move away from harmful behaviors, to live from love and not from hate. This natural desire comes from the totality, from wholeness itself.
            - Likewise, on the one hand, there is no separate author-chooser-doer, and EVERYTHING is a choiceless happening of the whole. AND, at the same time, there IS a power right here, a natural intelligence, a power of discernment—there is awareness. It isn’t “my” awareness, and yet, here it is, and “I” am not other than it. And so, once again, we cannot land on either the power of aware presence, or the powerlessness of the thinking mind and the imaginary “me.” Both are true: power and powerlessness, choice and choicelessness, something to do and nothing to do, and both are important.
            - And so, with practice, a growing sensitivity can develop to the difference between our conceptual maps and the living reality itself. Mistaking the map for the territory happens in such subtle and ubiquitous ways that discerning the difference is not always as obvious as it may sound. But with careful open attention, it becomes ever more easily noticed.
            - We can knowingly be both wave and ocean simultaneously—no conflict. This is called being in the world, but not of it. It is the unity of relative and absolute, impermanence and presence. We discover the possibility, in any moment, of leaving all our suffering behind—not forever after, but right now. It simply requires a shift of attention, a stopping, an opening.
            - Once we have discovered this possibility, once we have clearly SEEN the difference between the map and the territory (the concept and the perception), and once we have noticed that presence-awareness is actually never not here even in our most deluded moments, it is simply a matter of confirming this again and again, exploring it ever more deeply. And this is not some grueling, methodical, effortful practice, something the illusory separate “me” might do to “get somewhere.” It can be playful and fun and enjoyable. Maybe devotion is a good word—being devoted to this realization, this waking up, allowing it to flourish, basking in simple presence. It is an exploration motivated by love, curiosity and interest, not a burdensome task aimed at self-improvement. It is something we are drawn to naturally like the bee to the flower. And no one is actually doing this. It is a happening of the whole universe. So we don’t need to worry about not doing it right or not doing it enough. However it is happening is the perfect expression. It is doing itself.
            - The more this possibility of being liberated on the spot is accessed or noticed or recognized or deeply known, the more readily available it seems to become. And the more the thoughts and stories are seen for the make-believe they are, the less hypnotic power and believability they have. We simply keep exploring and confirming the insubstantiality and unresolvability of what appears, the fictional nature of all our thoughts, storylines, beliefs and ideas, and we keep marinating in the open, boundless presence that we are and that everything is. Effortless and simple. Hearing the traffic sounds, feeling the cool breeze on the skin, enjoying the sensations of breathing, tasting our food, washing the dishes, driving the car, doing our job, changing a diaper…just this!
            - And it’s never about past awakenings, future awakenings, or once-and-for-all forever awakenings. It’s always only about NOW. Being awake now. Because NOW is all there ever really is. Just notice how it actually IS. Wake up to the living reality of this moment. Re-turn again and again (NOW) to what is wholesome and trustworthy. Find out what that is, and be devoted to it. That, as I see it, is the heart of spiritual practice and awakening

        - Started processing highlights from [[Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body]]. A goldmine! Here is a quote that made an impression this evening:
            - "Ordinarily our thoughts compel us: our loathing or self-loathing generates one set of feelings and actions; our romantic fantasies quite another. But with strong mindfulness we can experience a deep sense in which self-loathing and romantic thoughts are the same: like all other thoughts, these are passing moments of mind. We don’t have to be chased through the day by our thoughts—they are a continuous series of short features, previews, and outtakes in a theater of the mind. #Quotes [[Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body]] #Psychology #Philosophy"
