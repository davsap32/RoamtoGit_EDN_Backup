    - [[Amazon]] delivered my new [[Audioengine A5+]] speakers - a quick delivery. I connected them to my [[Desktop PC]], lovely sound. I also tested streaming through the new speakers via [[Bluetooth]] from my [[Ipad]] - works vey well. In making place for the new speakers on my desk, I realised that it is high time to make progress in my [[Sort and Tidy]] projects. #[[Home Tech]]
