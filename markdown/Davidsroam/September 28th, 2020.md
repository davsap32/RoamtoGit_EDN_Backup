    - The inflammation in my fingers having lessened (though not completely gone), I have returned to [[Touch Typing]] training. At the moment I am using agilefingers.com and practicing with their "texts" section. [Link](https://agilefingers.com/sv/texter).  I have to be careful not to restart the inflammation. I really need to train - my typing accuracy is quite poor after having not trained for some weeks.
    - I looked at [[Andy Henson]]'s email course no. 14, about css themes. He describes how to apply a  style for each tag, compared to my solution which is to have one style for projects, another for areas etc. Worth considering.  [[Evernote]] [link](https://www.evernote.com/l/AATiaQWSg-BC2pSCFIn_0_azYzCKe-oTOa0/) to the original email. #[[Digital Garden]]

    - I made CSS styles for each of my tags within Projects and Areas.  I have listed the tags on the [[Styled tags]] page. #[[Digital Garden]]
    - Ate lunch with [[Kerstin]] and [[Amanda]] at [[Il Cibo]] restaurant. Nice lunch. 
    - Spoke to [[Esther]]. she is reading the book [[The Tools]] and finding it interesting. #Books 
    - After finishing [[The Book of Not]] I have returned to [[The Lessons of History]]. Really very good. It is a great pleasure to have time to read these wonderful books. I find that highlighting interesting passages with a view to extracting #Evergreens increases my concentration and allows me to get more out of my reading. #Books
