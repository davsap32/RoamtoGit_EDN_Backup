    - Reflecting on an article about [[Time Anxiety]]:  #Reflections
        - "Define what “time well spent” means to you: sit down, and think about what really makes you happy and [gets you in the flow](https://nesslabs.com/flow), without overthinking about how feasible the final outcome would be. Just think of your output and how it makes you feel to work on producing it. For example, don’t think about happy it would make you to publish a book. Ask yourself if you really enjoy writing. Don’t think about how proud you would be to run a marathon. Question whether you like running. Create a short list of activities you really enjoy and that bring value to yourself or to the world."
        - I don't think that the problem is knowing what activities are satisfying. Rather it is a question of rampant ambition; long lists of books to read etc. Time anxiety in my case is due to setting goals which are unachievable given limited time. There is an element of hoarding in this, e.g. hoarding books on a list (as well as the books themselves). If I could get used to the idea that if I am doing something which feels meaningful, I don't have to worry about whatever I am not doing at that time. #[[Productivity]] #Health
    - Went #bathing - 18 C in the air, quite windy. A pleasure as always.
    - [[Lightroom]] has been at work for some hours on my desktop PC synching folders with [[SmugMug]] galleries.
- 16:52
    - [[Kerstin]] has just returned from [[Arboga]]. I have prepared potato gratin and spare ribs, should be good. 
    - The [[Lightroom]] sync requires me to manually match hundreds of images which [[Lightroom]] could not match. On top of everything [[Lightroom]] crashed in the middle of the matching process, so I do not know how much of my work was saved. I hope not to have to do this again - I need to think through how to backup [[Lightroom]] in a way which will maintain sync with [[SmugMug]] if I for some reason need to restore the [[Lightroom]] database from backup, as was the case now. #[[Lightroom Cleanup]]
