    - I did factory resets on my [[Dlink DIR-815]] and [[ASUS RT-AC51U]] routers, assigned new admin passwords and set them as access points. set the same SSID for all routers (HOME54 & HOME54_5G), including the main router [[CBN-GW7557CE]]. (192.168.0.1). Manually set the IP adress of the Dlink router to 192.168.0.200. Updated the firmware of the ASUS router. I should consider replacing the Dlink router with a new router, as the latest firmware update is from 2013. #[[Home Tech]]
