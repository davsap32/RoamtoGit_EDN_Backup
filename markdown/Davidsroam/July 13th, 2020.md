we spent the night at Hotel Magazin1 in Hablingsbo, ate dinner there and breakfast. We both liked the place and the service. Drove via Sandholme (Eksta coast) towards Visby. Beautiful drive. Ate lunch at Warfsholms pensionat. Now we are in Visby, our boat leaves at 17.30 this evening. [[Kerstin]] is walking in the town and I have sat myself at a cafe near the car.
- Today I finished [[Reading]] [[Sönke Ahrens]] book, and I am full of enthusiasm to practice his method. Not that I have anything specific to publish, but I do read widely and need to find a way to organise thoughts, questions and information from my [[Reading]]. I have signed up with roam for a trial period and may well subscribe when the time comes in August. I am also considering subscribing to [[Nat Eliason]]‘s Roam training. 
- I returned to [[Joyce Carol Oates]] book.
- [[Samuel]]has booked a session with a private family therapist on Wednesday at 15:30. [[Kerstin]] and I will take care of the children then. The therapist costs 1500 SEK per hour, the council alternative is free but there is a 9-week queue ([[Samuel]]has put his name up for that as well).
