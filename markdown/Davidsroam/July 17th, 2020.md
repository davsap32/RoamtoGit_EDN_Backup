    - [[Kerstin]] and Susanne are preparing for a #bathing outing to Lilla Älgsjön. I am going to stay at home instead and work with:
        - Workflow for notetaking
            - [[Onyx]]
Onyx highlights and annotations are stored in one text file per highlight/annotation in a folder with the same name as the title of the book. I intend to write a Python program which connects to the Onyx via FTP and downloads and concatenates the text files. I can then copy/paste to Roam (and/or Notion)
Requires an android FTP server. The one I am using is "FTP server"
            - Ibooks
Notes and highlights can be reached via the content menu. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FDavidsroam%2FmXDBkWZlmA.png?alt=media&token=ef5998bc-9665-462e-b8a4-f8f4ce070c12). Choose Notes tab/Share icon/Edit notes/select all/share/email
            - Articles on Internet. 
Save article to Instapaper. Highlight and add notes in Instapaper. Use IFTTT to   append any new comment in Instapaper to a Dropbox file “**comments.txt**” in the Dropbox folder IFTTT/Instapaper. IFTTT script:
                - - “{{HighlightedText}}”<br>
- <br>
- {{Comment}}<br>
- <br>
- {{Title}}<br>
