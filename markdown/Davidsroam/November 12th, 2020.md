    - Saw a #Video in which [[Nat Eliason]] showed how he copy/pastes from [[Evernote]] to [[Roam Research]]. He pastes to a text editor in order to do  "Find and replace" before pasting into [[Roam Research]]. This is a good idea, I could use it to remove info on highlight color which is added to each highlighted text by the [[Kindle]] app. The text editor he uses is [[Sublime]], but I don't see the need to acquire an additional text editor. I can use Microsoft Word or Google Docs. #[[Digital Garden]]
    - I suspect that at the time of my harddisk crash, the [[Lightroom]] xmp files were not stored in the same folders as the images (which were on a external hard drive), but must have been stored in the catalog, on the SSD drive which crashed. Since a couple of months back, I am importing new images as DNG (in which metadata is stored in the same file as the image). I will convert older images to DNG once I have rated and edited them over time. I can take a copy of my backup catalogs the next time I am in Stockholm, hoping to retrieve xmp files from there. #[[Lightroom Cleanup]]

    - Continued to listen to a #Podcast with [[Scott Barry Kaufman]] and [[Carol Dweck]] about growth mindset. [[Carol Dweck]]â€™s book [[Mindset]] is probably well worth reading. #Books

    - While washing dishes, listened to the remaining parts of a #Podcast about breathing with [[Rangam Chatterjee]] and [[James Nestor]]. [[James Nestor]] says that most people breathe too quickly, the ideal is about 8 breaths per minute. I should measure my own breathing rate. Also check out his book. #Health #Books
