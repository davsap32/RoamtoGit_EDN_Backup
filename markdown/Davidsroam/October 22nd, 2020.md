    - Sitting at [[Torsgatan]] after meetings this morning, core team planning meeting soon, afer that time to leave for Norrköping. I had a discussion with [[Peter]] this morning about his need to work together on approving Service Descriptions. He feels that this is too much of a burden to place on one individual - he needs someone who is involved inthe detailed work to consult with and to support him in discussions with service owners, SMEs, managers, colleagues in UK etc. I could help him based on my ability to understand the work to be done, but I value my time and am unwilling to put in the hours. I work about 30-40 hours per month for [[SHB]] and that is about as much work as I want to do for the bank. #Work

    - #[[Creative writing]] #Podcast While travelling, listened to a lecture by [[Larry McEnerny]] from University of Chicago om effective writing - talking mostly about writing with an academic audience. His points:
        - Writing is succesful only if it creates value for the reader.
        - Value can be created for the reader by solving a problem that affects the reader.
