            - I’m never saying seeking is wrong or bad, nor am I ever saying that suffering is inevitable or that liberation is a myth. This post clarifies what I mean by that, and it’s a long post. If you do want to comment, please read it all first. 
            - There’s a Zen koan that goes like this: A student says to the teacher, “I’m reaching for the light. Please show me the light.” To which the teacher replies, “Forget about the light—show me the reaching.”
            - When I was hanging out with this koan, I noticed that everything is reaching. Plants are reaching for the light, evolution is reaching for some new possibility, humans are constantly reaching for new understandings, new places, new experiences. It seems to be the very nature of the universe to expand, to explore itself, to reach out.
            - The spiritual search typically begins because we want to stop suffering, and we sense that some of our suffering may be unnecessary. We sense that there is a bigger picture, a different possibility, a potential for not being lost in misery and confusion, for not being seemingly trapped in this separate little capsule-identity of “me,” desperately trying to defend ourselves psychologically, to be somebody special, to belong, to be understood, to compensate for our feelings of deficiency and lack. Maybe we have tasted a radically different possibility. Maybe we have seen that nothing is as solid as it seems, or that somehow everything goes together as one indivisible whole. Maybe we have tasted moments of spaciousness, free from all self-concern. Naturally, we want to find that ease of being, that wonderment, that spaciousness that we sensed was somehow the deepest possibility. And so, like a plant reaching for the sun, we reach for that light. 
            - At first (and probably for most of us ongoingly in ever-more subtle ways), we imagine that what we seek is outside of us: in someone else, in the future, in some event or special experience. And that may be a natural and necessary aspect of how we discover, again and again, that what we seek is closer than close, ever-present, right here. 
            - But, contrary to what we may have imagined, making this discovery does not mean that we live forever after in perpetual bliss. Pain and painful circumstances are indeed inevitable. But the ways we suffer over all of that pain can indeed fall away (not forever after, but right now). I can certainly testify from my own direct experience, as I know many of you also can, that there is indeed the possibility of freedom from suffering, of being liberated on the spot. 
            - But importantly, there is no persisting separate self to be in some particular persisting state of feeling free or feeling happy. All experiences are transitory, and life is necessarily a dance of inseparable polarities. There is no light apart from the dark. Yes, boundless presence is actually never lost, but the realization of that is not always our lived experience. For most (if not all) of us, or we could say, for impersonal consciousness itself, there is a never-ending dance in this manifestation between enlightenment and delusion. As human beings, sometimes we feel contracted down into that tight little capsule of “me,” seemingly lost in a movie of confusion and misery. And yet, there is always the possibility of waking up from the movie, of being liberated on the spot, not forever after, but right now.
            - So I’m not denying the possibility of enlightenment, if that word simply means waking up in this moment from the trance of encapsulation, waking up to the boundless wonder of here and now. But I AM denying that there are permanently enlightened people, and I AM suggesting that seeking to become such a person, or claiming to be one, is delusion.
            - Enlightenment (awakening, liberation, realization, whatever you want to call it) is not in some remembered past experience, nor is it in some hoped for future. It is only NOW. And while it may be helpful to have the IDEA that, “Everything is boundless presence, even apparent delusion,” or that, “There is no self to be liberated,” or that, “Nothing needs to happen,” as ideas or beliefs, these won’t hold up when the going gets rough. Belief is always shadowed by doubt. As Nisargadatta so beautifully put it, “Your begging bowl may be of pure gold, but as long as you do not know it, you are a pauper.” 
            - Hence, we have spiritual teachings, teachers, practices, methods, non-methods, and so on, all of which can potentially help us. But, of course, paradoxically, they can also hinder us, especially when the teachers are themselves lost in delusion, as ALL teachers sometimes are. The fact is, all teachers are human beings, and all spiritual communities are made up of imperfect humans like you and me. Even when the community is founded on the sincere intention to be open, undogmatic, and non-hierarchical, the opposite tendencies will sometimes show up because those things are built into our human psychology and biology. Sometimes the imperfections will be big and obvious and horrific, and sometimes they will be very, very subtle, but imperfections will always be a part of every human endeavor, spirituality included. To expect otherwise is folly.
            - But we do tend to expect spiritual teachers to be perfect, and many of them are only too willing to accept our projections and pretend (to themselves as well) that they are indeed perfectly enlightened beings. We also tend to want our spiritual journey to result in our own perfection. And that never happens. In that sense, disillusionment is a good thing. But it may not be such a good thing if it leads us to throw away the baby with the bathwater. Because there IS a baby in there, there really is. And we discover that jewel (that precious newborn) not once and for all, but again and again, always NOW.
            - The spiritual path is truly going nowhere, i.e. now-here. It is a pathless path in the sense that every moment is fresh and new, and every person is a unique being from moment to moment. We never step into the same river twice. And yet, our path may include practices that seem to be (but never really are) repetitive.
            - Teachers and spiritual companions can point out the (ever-present) destination, that which is already right here—and they can help to illuminate the apparent obstacles and common pitfalls. And all of that can be very helpful. But no one can wake up for us. We must each see and feel and think and pay attention and discover what’s true for ourselves. 
            - As I tried to illuminate in my previous post, in part through my own confession, spirituality can become toxic when teachers pretend to be all knowing and permanently beyond it all, when they feed into our deficiency stories and create the expectation of a future finish-line to cross, a line that they supposedly have crossed. And those pretenses can get subtler and subtler. The desire to be somebody special might be easy to see in people who exude grandiosity, but this desire to be special is a very common human tendency, fed by our culture, and in some form, we probably all have it—not every minute, but at times. Some of us may not be self-aware enough to have noticed it. It can be very hard to see things in ourselves that fly in the face of our self-image and our best intentions. We all too easily see these defects in others, but not so easily in ourselves. And seeing delusion in ourselves is what really serves us, not pointing fingers at others. 
            - Of course, anything we try to say about spirituality inevitably falls short because the spiritual journey is so apparently paradoxical. Both sides of these apparently contradictory recognitions are true: 
            - Nothing needs to happen, and there is a liberating shift that can happen.
            - There is nowhere to go, and there is the possibility of being liberated on the spot.
            - There is no choice, and there is a choice.
            - There is a path, and there is no path.
            - You are already whole and complete just as you are, and there’s room for improvement. 
            - It’s all a dream, and it’s totally real.
            - Nothing matters, and everything matters.
            - Lots of teachings land on one side or the other. But the teachings I find most true and most alive don’t fixate anywhere. They SEE that no map is the territory, that no formulation can capture the ever-changing, ever-evolving living reality. Wakefulness, as I mean it, is BEING ALIVE as this here-now living reality. And, of course, we always already ARE that—there is nothing outside of that, not really. But again, if that is not realized (made real), it’s just a belief, subject to doubt. That’s where the rubber meets the road, as they say. 
            - And, as I keep repeating, the living realization of what sets us free and what seems to bind us is rarely, if ever, a one-time event that permanently ends all delusion. The dance is unending, always NOW. 
            - And this liberation to which spirituality points includes having cancer, losing all your money, and being in a world where there is all manner of unfathomable cruelty and horror along with astonishing beauty and kindness. We each contain it all, and the manifestation will always be a dance of polarities. Utopia is a fantasy. Human perfection is a fantasy. But still, life moves us to reach, to seek, to wake up, to find that new-born heart-mind.
