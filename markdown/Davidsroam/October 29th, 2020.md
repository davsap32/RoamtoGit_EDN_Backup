    - [[Roam Research]] In his latest "Letters from a Roaman", [[Andy Henson]] mentioned a new export format which he recommends using for backup:
        - The Roam team have added a third option to the export feature, **EDN**. It stands for Extensible Data Notation, and it enables a lossless backup of your Roam graph. **I highly recommend using this format when you take a backup now**. Using only Markdown or JSON means that you could lose some data if the worst happened and you wanted to recreate your Roam graph
        - As yet, the [[Roam Research]] import menu does not include this option.

    - Met up with [[Samuel]] and his family near Sörby Herrgård (Bråvalla) to take pictures of the family, [[Samuel]] wants to take prints with him to [[Cape Town]]. We made some nice pictures, I will print them for him.
    - I worked together with [[Kerstin]] to make prints for a calendar that we will make for [[Esther]].
    - I finished processing the highlights for [[Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body]]. Lots of useful insights in this book. #Philosophy #Books #[[Digital Garden]]
