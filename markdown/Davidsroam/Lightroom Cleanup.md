    - **Images which are not rated to be rated or removed**. Many images seem to have lost their rating (perhaps because the sidecar xmp file has become separated from the image), I can use the [[SmugMug]] galleries to compare and identify images which I had previously rated.
    - **Missing images to be found and added.** One way of knowing that images are missing is that they are present in the [[SmugMug]] galleries but missing in the pictures folders. I can look for images in the various backup catalogs:
        - On the [[Seagate Backup Plus Drive]]
        - On the optical media bakup which I took in April 2019
    - **Adjustments **to be made as necessary to the images.
