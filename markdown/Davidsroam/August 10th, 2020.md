    - Thinking about the [[Pandemic Zen]] podcast with [[Paul Gerstein]].  Attending a sensation, not what it is but **that it is**. **That it is** being the ground of all experience. Sensation can be experienced as if it were in the body, but all sensation is within **that it is**. **That it is** has no locality and no attributes. #[[Philosophy]] #Inbox
    - I have booked a journey with [[Kerstin]] tomorrow, returning on Thursday. Itinerary:

    - [[Books]] [[Digital Garden]] I have spent some time "digesting" two books:
        - [[Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results]]
        - [[The Elephant in the Brain]]
        - My method is as follows:
            - Go through the highlights made for each book, identify statements that I feel will make good #[[Evergreens]]. Mark these in bold and with the #[[Evergreens]] tag.
            - Sort text which will help to explain each of the #[[Evergreens]], indented under each note. Avoid repetition and unnecessary content.
            - Use the filter to remove all the #[[Evergreens]] and the text associated with each note.
            - Delete the remaining text.
            - Remove the filter to restore the #[[Evergreens]]

    - #[[Photography]] [[Articles]] Read an interesting article by [[Danny Lyon]] in [[The Guardian]] on his best photo. [Link ](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/06/danny-lyon-best-photograph-two-boys-and-a-puppy-in-knoxville-tennessee) #Inbox
    - [[Kerstin]] feels that [[Amanda]] needs some time with her, she has taken [[Amanda]] #bathing and will bring her home to dinner.
    - "Digested" two more #Books : [[Art and Fear. Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking]] and [[Peak_ Secrets from the New Science of Expertise]]. Now I can begin examining possibilities of recombining #[[Evergreens]]. #[[Digital Garden]]
    - I have rearranged my [[Weekly Review]] template, so that the actions are not [[TODO]]s , rather actions are a checklist. For each action I can enter the date performed as an indent under the action.
    - Today, I am quite pleased with having spent some time working on my [[Roam Research]] database, more specfically I have made some progress with my #[[Digital Garden]]
    - Still an issue with inflammation in the ring finger of my right hand. Will have to wait to do more [[Touch Typing]] training.
