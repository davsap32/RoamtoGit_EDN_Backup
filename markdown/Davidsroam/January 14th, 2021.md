    - [[Kerstin]] came in this morning to congratulate me on my birthday. This evening we ate at Restaurant [[Arv]], good food, very pleasant.
    - [[Samuel]] called to wish me on my birthday, he mentioned that he had postponed his trip to [[Cape Town]] until after the lockdown is lightened in [[South Africa]]. A few hours later, he called to say that flights from SA via a number of countries including the Netherlands had been restricted further, so he is relieved not to be travelling.
