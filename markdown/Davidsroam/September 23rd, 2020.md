    - Ate dinner with [[Per Engström]] and Anette, showed some of our pictures: journeys, grandchildren, some of [[Kerstin]]s artwork. We bathed under the stars in Per’s jacuzzi. Per has made some wise investments in eco-technology, he has solar panels  on his garage roof and sells electricity to the net, he has geothermal heating to warm his house and a Prius hybrid car - his energy costs are negligible. His cost savings for the solar panels are 10% of the investment each year. 
    - Per is preparing breakfast, after which we will start our journey home.
    - Before dinner, we drove to a beach resort called [[Katrinelund Sjökrog och Gästgiveri]], it looked like a nice place for an outing, to eat and perhaps to stay overnight. #Örebro
    - Both [[Per Engström]] and I bathed there. 
    - [[Per Engström]] mentioned that his daughter [[Lena]] has epilepsy since the age of about 12. She is working as a teacher.

    - Returned home from [[Örebro]] earlier this afternoon, ate lunch at home. Fetched my new watch [[Casio 3283]] - I read the instructions carefully concerning water resistance. It's not OK to press the buttons on the watch while wet. So I  can start the timer before immersing myself and check when it is time to leave the water. I can stop the timer later when the clock and my hands are dry. #[[Home Tech]]
    - Went #bathing  in [[Lillsjön]] - warm and sunny weather, 20 C in the air. 11 C in the water. I stayed in the water for a little more than 2 minutes. Enjoyed being able to time myself with my new watch.
    - [[Kerstin]] is away at a meeting in town concerning Kulturnatten.
    - I received an answer from [[Logitech]] to my query about pairing the [[Logitech Bluetooth Audio Adapter]] with my Apple [[Airpod Pros]].  I got the impression from [[Logitech]]s answer that they were talking about a different device entirely. I have repeated my request and described in detail what happens when I try to pair the [[Logitech Bluetooth Audio Adapter]] with my [[Airpod Pros]]. #[[Home Tech]]
