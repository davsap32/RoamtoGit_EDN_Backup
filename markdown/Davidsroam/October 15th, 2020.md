    - In Stockholm today, waiting at the moment for my first meeting at [[Torsgatan]]. I took one of the new matresses I had bought to [[Furusundsgatan 14]], slept on it last night - a big improvement, it makes the bed mich more comfortable. 
    - As I left [[Furusundsgatan 14]] this morning, I was careful to put the lock in service position, to allow technicians to come into the flat to check ventilation valves.

    - Sitting on the train on the way home after meetings in Stockholm today. Challenging to establish planning routines in a situation in which we lack management support for our activities. We have planned a new IRL meeting next week.
- 19:57
    - Went [[bathing]] after coming home, a nice way to shake off the journey.
    - While travelling, finished reading [[Still Writing: The Perils and Pleasures of a Creative Life]]. Now i have quiute a lot of highlighted material to process.
