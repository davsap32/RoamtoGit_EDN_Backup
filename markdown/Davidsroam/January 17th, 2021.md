    - Finished reading [[Rising Out of Hatred]]. #Books
    - Listened to a #Podcast with [[Michael Moore]] and [[Daryl Johnson]]. Daryl Johnson worked for a US security organisation in 2012 when he wrote a paper warning of the threat from white supremacy groups. The paper was suppressed, he lost his job and his department was dismantled.
    - Found two-book biography of [[Hitler]] by [[Volker Ullrich]] which received positive reviews. I'd like to read them. #Books
    - Looking at a possible journey to [[Gran Canaria]] for the whole family. to [[Playa del Cura]], where we stayed previously. The journeys & accommodation will cost about 60 kkr for all.

    - [[Amanda]] and [[Samuel]] and family will eat dinner with us this evening. I fetched Amanda earlierr, we walked together to [[Lillsjön]] to see if it is possible to bathe there. There is in fact a small hole by a bathing ladder, so it is fully possible to bathe.
    - I fetched gravel by [[Lilsjön]] parking.

    - We had dinner together with the whole family - as usual, [[Ellen]] was very demanding and noisy, always forcing attention toward herself.
