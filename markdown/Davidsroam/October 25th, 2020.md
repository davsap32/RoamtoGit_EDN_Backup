    - Last night we changed from summer to winter time. I woke at 05:20 winter time which corresponds to 06:20 if the clocks hadn't changed - not too bad, though, as I was in bed before 10 pm yesterday evening.
    - Yesterday evening I spent some time browsing through books on my [[Ipad]] - time well spent. Rather that than ploughing through books or parts of books which are not very interesting. Amongst other books, I browsed through [[The Oxygen Advantage: The Simple, Scientifically Proven Breathing Techniques for a Healthier, Slimmer, Faster, and Fitter You]]. I think that the breathing exercises in this book are worth trying. #Books #Health
    - Watched a [[youtube]] #Video about [[Touch Typing]]. The advice here is to focus on accuracy before speed.

    - [[Roam Research]] Watched a [[youtube]] video with [[R.J.Nestor]] titled "Content creation through iteration: Block refs & "Replace with..." in Roam Research". His method for progressive  editing of drafts is:
        - Copy block refs from draft 1 to draft 2
        - Replace the block refs in draft 2 with original
        - Replace the block refs in draft 1 with text and alias

    - [[Samuel]] called earlier this afternoon, he wanted to go picking mushrooms together. We did so, together with [[Ellen]], in the forests by the Heljelids. We found quite a lot of trumpet mushrooms, much more than I have found earlier this season. We spoke about:
        - His journey to [[Cape Town]], he is proud and happy to be going there on business, as well as hopefull that he can find a way forward to employ skilled programmers at [[Angry Creative]], because this is a serious bottleneck for the company.
        - [[Samuel]] and [[Josefine]] are still going to therapy sessions together, [[Samuel]] seems optimistic that they should be able to find a way to stay together in the long run, which is more than he was previously. The sessions are once every three weeks.
        - [[Leo]] is seeing a therapist, for which [[Samuel]] is very glad. [[Samuel]] understands that [[Leo]] has difficulties in understanding his own feelings and acting appropriately based on them.
        - [[Amanda]] has mentioned to [[Kerstin]] that her mentor at work is off sick a lot of the time, so [[Amanda]] is not getting the help she needs to learn the routines she will be responsible for. [[Samuel]]'s view on this is that it is [[Amanda]] who has been on sick leave (80% of her first month) and that her mentor is working from home and available for [[Amanda]] via link.
    - [[Kerstin]] phoned from the train - she will be home at about 10pm this evening. She had nearly missed her train, but just managed to get on in time. She had enjoyed her weekend course, but did not like the food.
    - While making food this evening, listened to a #Podcast with [[Ranjan Chatterjee]] and [[Daniel Lieberman]] about Exercise from a perspective of human evolutionary biology. Very interesting. One of Liebermans points was that humans are evolved to conserve energy, it is quite natural that many people have difficulties in establishing exercise routines. Lieberman has written a book called [[Exercised: The Science of Physical Activity, Rest and Health]]. I would like to check it out. #Books  #Health
    - I think that the queue system for the [[Castro]] #Podcast app is very good. It is easy to add new podcasts to the listening queue, as well as to "sideload" audio tracks from [[youtube]] #[[Video]]s
