    - I got an answer from [[Erik Plachta]] to my request on [[Geneva]] chat for help in getting [[Roam Backup/Restore]] to [[GitHub]] to work again. [Link](https://github.com/ErikPlachta/RoamResearch-Backup-to-GIT-Template) to his [[GitHub]] template. I followed his instructions to create and configure a copy of his template - it has run successfully once so far.

    - This morning, [[Kerstin]] took [[Amanda]] and her rabbit to the vet to have it castrated. [[Amanda]] came home with Kerstin and will be here until it is time to fetch the rabbit later this afternoon.

    - [[Kerstin]] and [[Amanda]] fetched Amanda's rabbit and came home for lunch. [[Kerstin]] had an attack of nausea and vomiting during lunch. No obvious cause - she had not eaten since yesterday evening, so it can't be something she ate.

    - [[Kerstin]] has driven [[Amanda]] home with her rabbit.
