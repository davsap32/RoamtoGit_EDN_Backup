    - One of my favorite distinctions on @RoamResearch is choosing between **query** and **mentions**. I use **query** if it's hard-coded—e.g., items I'm pulling into my #[[Inbox]]. I use **mentions** if I need to be able to filter results—e.g., narrowing down my reading list. 
    - My [[Reading List]] doesn't need its OWN linked references, but instead the refs of [[unread]] or [[read again]]. I can use {{[[mentions]]: [[unread]]}}, then filter types (book, article, etc.) depending what I'm interested in reading. Extremely useful to gather pages together!
