    - After much work comparing alternatives, [[Kerstin]] and I decided on a journey to [[Crete]] in September with [[TUI]]. Booked and paid a deposit about a half an hour ago, but have not received a confirmation yet. I chatted with [[TUI]], they said there were delays in confirming bookings, I should call them tomorrow if I have not received a confirmation by then. #Journeys

    - Now we have received confirmation of our booking with [[TUI]] to [[Crete]] in September.
