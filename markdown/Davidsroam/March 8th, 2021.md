    - #[[Home Tech]] It seems that the Analog-Digital converter I have been using to connect my [[Desktop PC]] to my [[Altec Lansing]] loudspeakers has stopped working - probably in connection with the power outage yesterday. The analog jack on the speaker is broken since many years ago, so the digital input is the only way to connect (S/PDIF cable). I could purchase a [new analog to digital converter](https://www.amazon.se/LINDY-analog-stereo-digital-ljudomvandlare/dp/B002AL4XVO/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=analog+till+digital&qid=1615147697&sr=8-3), instead I have ordered a new speaker system . The question is if I should also purchase the a-d converter, or discard the [[Altec Lansing]] speaker system. I have purchased a bluetooth USB adapter for my [[Desktop PC]] and tested it with my [[Bose Revolve+ Soundlink]] speaker. I feel that the sound quality when playing from the computer is inferior compared to using my [[Iphone]] or [[Ipad]] as source.
