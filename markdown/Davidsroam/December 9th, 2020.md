    - Lay awake for several hours last night - probably due to the working day yesterday being quite intensive.
    - Listening to a #Podcast episode of [[The Knowledge Project]], a discussion about integrative strategy (what would have to be true for this to work?). Also weaknesses in the present model of governance for widely owned share companies - the members of the board cannot be trusted to represent the interests of the shareholders. Choosing a narrative which helps deal with fear. [[Shane Parrish]] talking to [[Roger Martin]]

    - Finished reading [[Unholy]]. Interesting, but too many facts. I ended up skimming through a lot of the book. About the political might of the religious right in USA and other countries. Also, their autocratic tendencies. #Books
    - Started reading [[Out of Mesopotamia]]. Strong opening - a pleasure to read. About fighting with the Shias in the war against Isis in Syria.
