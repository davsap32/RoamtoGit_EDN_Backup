    - When we went #bathing together at [[Katrinelund Sjökrog och Gästgiveri]], [[Per Engström]] mentioned a Danish exponent of the same type of training as taught by [[Wim Hof]]. His name is  [[Stig Severinsen]]. Per sent a link to an introductory viideo:

        - I have download a free pdf provided by [[Stig Severinsen]].

    - I get messages on my [[Ipad]] that my [[Icloud]] storage is full. This is because I have been downloading books from [[Calibre]] to the Ipad. It seems that it is not possible to change the dowload location to other cloud services than [[Icloud]]. It doesn't really matter, I only need to store books locally on the Ipad long enough to copy them to my reader apps. Rather than paying for more [[Icloud]] storage, I have changed the download destination to the downloads folder on the [[Ipad]] and emptied the downloads folder on [[Icloud]].
    - Went #bathing - 17 C in the air and 11 C in the water. Today I did not feel the discomfort of the cold in the water as I usually do. I stayed in the water for 2:30 minutes.
