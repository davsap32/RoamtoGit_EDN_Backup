- How I run my business
    - 2020 was my 10th year as an entrepreneur. Here are some "rules" I try to follow after a decade of stumbling around building my company. 
    - (Not rules for all businesses. Just how I choose to run mine.)
        - Create something useful.
            - If it doesn't deliver value to the reader, don't do it. 
        - Create something timeless. 
            - The more evergreen your work, the longer timeline you have to find success. 
        - Optimize for time before money.
            - The most important question is, "How do I want to spend my days?"
            - Make as few choices as possible that violate your answer. 
        - Build assets that compound. 
            - Eliminate problems, responsibilities, and obligations that compound.
            - Your business should feel easier to sustain each year. 
        - Optimize for reach over revenue.
            - Choose to reach more people rather than squeeze out another dollar.
            - You'll help more folks and the person with the largest audience usually ends up with more money anyway. 
        - Once you start making money, do not sacrifice your lifestyle simply to make more money.
            - Again, first ask, "How do I want to spend my days?" 
            - Then, within that subset, "How can I make the most money possible?" 
        - Be patient. Think longer-term than anyone else in your industry.
            - Be impatient. Don't let a day pass without doing something that contributes to your long-term vision. 
            - Continually ask, "What is the highest leverage thing we can do right now?" 
            - Then, spend at least two minutes today working on that thing. 
        - Reduce the scale, not your standards.
            - Aspire to do exceptional work and apply that standard to everything.
            - Book. Article. Tweet. Doesn't matter the size.
            - In the long run, your brand is the quality of work you do. Sacrifice quality⁠—anywhere⁠—and you sacrifice the brand. 
        - Own your distribution. 
            - (In my case, my website and email list.) 
        - Spend as much time as possible doing the actual work (the thing that delivers value) and as little time as possible doing the "pre-work" that fills the calendars of most people.
            - Example: Have as few meetings as possible. 
        - Build a small team of exceptional people. Recruit exceptional employees. Hire exceptional freelancers. Work with exceptional partners.
            - Always seek to work with the best and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Great people want to work with you because great people already do. 
        - Run lean. 
            - Hire slowly and keep your team as small as possible. 
            - Find a way to do it without hiring another person. Use freelancers and build partnerships before creating another full-time role. 
        - Stay small even if you can afford to be big.
            - The more people you have on the team, the harder it is to get everyone rowing in the same direction. 
            - The cost of consensus is more expensive than the cost of payroll. 
        - Share the profit with employees.
            - Get the incentives aligned. Everyone should get a slice of the upside. 
            - When the business wins, we all win. 
        - Be easy to work with. Nobody wants to add friction to their life.
            - Make sure each relationship you build is a win for the other side.
            - Win-win is the only kind of relationship that is sustainable. 
        - Negotiate expenses yearly. 
            - Analyze all of your expenses and eliminate anything you no longer need.
            - With your biggest expenses, look up the latest pricing of their competitors and ask them to beat the lowest price. 
            - If there is no relevant competitor, ask for 20% off. 
        - Continually reach out to people who do the kind of work you aspire to do. 
            - Build friendships with exceptional people. 
        - Reinvent yourself.
            - Time erodes every advantage. 
            - Evolve or die.
