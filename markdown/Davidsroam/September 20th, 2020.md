    - After beginning to sketch workflow for capture of notes, I arrived at the conclusion that I should subscribe to [[Readwise]], so as not to have to maintain several different channels for data capture. My trial subscription expires on [[September 30th, 2020]] so I should subscribe before or then or on that day.
    - I will use [[Evernote]] for quick capture - ideas, items to purchase etc.

    - While shopping and vacuuming, listened to two audio files: #Podcast
        - Andrew Neil interviews Anders Tegnell - a second wave and what Sweden got right   SpectatorTV
            - No special news, interesting to  hear how Anders Tegnell describes the Swedish experience of the pandemic.
        - Andrew Neil’s US Election in 60 Minutes – Will Trump win again   SpectatorTV
            - Good panel, good discussion. Who will win in November is in the balance, according to the panel. Up for discussion: Black Lives Matter, China, Covid, Bidens ability or lack thereof to enthuse his voters. Risks for Biden in debating with Trump.

    - [[Annethe  and Anders]] have just left after having eaten dinner with us. Quite pleasant. They are both divorced from previous marriages, we spoke about marital problems between [[Samuel]] and [[Josefine]], Anders spoke a little about his experience of divorce.
    - Will pack tomorrow morning and leave for Örebro.
