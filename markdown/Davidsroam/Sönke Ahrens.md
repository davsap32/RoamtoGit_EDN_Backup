- #Quotes from Sönke’s book
“To achieve a critical mass, it is crucial to distinguish clearly between three types of notes:

1.  Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two.

2.  Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box.

3.  Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished.”

Onyx highlights and annotations are stored in one text file per highlight/annotation in a folder with the same name as the title of the book. I intend to write a Python program which connects to the Onyx via FTP and downloads and concatenates the text files. I can then copy/paste to Roam (and/or Notion)
Requires an android FTP server. The one I am using is "FTP server""

- [[Nat Eliason]]‘s method:
    - Record highlights from book as well as own notes (own notes should reflect your own reflections/ideas). Tag own notes with book title, as these notes may be moved from the book page to other pages later. Nat uses the Sublime text editor to add the tag at the end of multiple lines simultaneously. This can however be done in Word using the find/replace dialog (More>> Special. The paragraph character is represented as ^p).
