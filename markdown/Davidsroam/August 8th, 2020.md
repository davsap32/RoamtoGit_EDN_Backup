    - Just returned from Lilla Älgsjön, where we bathed and ate lunch. Notes from there:
        - Reading a non fiction book is like digging for gold. There is a lot of earth and some nuggets.
        - Many popular nonfiction books summarize and reference lots of sources other than the author's own work. In this way, they make it possible to overview a large field of knowledge. However, the sources are chosen to support the author's thesis.
        - I am  very ambitious in building up a roam-based knowledge system. I am going to read and highlight lots of books, from the highlights I will extract ideas in the form of evergreen notes and from these I will draw new conclusions. All leading where? Maybe I cannot know in advance where it might lead. Would I be more satisfied if I were less driven? Do I have a choice?
        - One of the potential costs of this ambition is that I might spend less time reading non-fiction than I would like. The pursuit of knowledge should not be an end in itself, rather a pleasurable pastime.
        - The method of knowledge building involves collecting bits and pieces of insight, not necessarily for their intrinsic value but for the potential of combining them into new insights. 
    - Continued reading [[The Elephant in the Brain]].
