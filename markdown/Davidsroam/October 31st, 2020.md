    - [[David Vargas]] attribute table sort js extension seems to be broken. I need to check that I am getting the code from the right place: [[Attribute Tables]]

    - I sent a DM to [[David Vargas]] on [[Twitter]] about the problem. He promised to look into it.

    - [[Samuel]] fetched the children at about 11 this morning - it was a pleasure to have them here and a pleasure when they left. I feel out of sorts when I I'm forced to stay out of my bubble for too long. I showed [[Samuel]] prints of the pictures we had taken on [[October 29th, 2020]]. He mentioned that [[Josefine]] was not peased with how she looked in the family picture. We will try to find a better one when they are here tomorrow evening.
    - [[David Vargas]] asked for a screenshot of the [[Attribute Tables]] sorting extension code. He advised me to remove a section of the code

        - I did as he advised, so the only code of [[David Vargas]] I use is now that included in [[Shawn Murphy]]'s table filtering extension. Now the attribute table sorting works again. It is a real luxury to be supported by the developer himself when I have software problems.
        - I've been [[bathing]] and done my PT. WHM breathing will have to wait until I can do it on an empty stomach, but I could do my meditation now.
    - [[Kenneth]] phoned, we spoke for a while. 
        - He enjoyed the book [[One Blade of Grass]]. We spoke about open awareness and how near it always is.
        - [[Rafi]] is still trying to start her business, working at finding financing.
        - They have redone the bathrooms in the house.
        - [[Kenneth]] reminded me of a link he had sent - he wanted children & grandchildren to make video messages for [[Esther]], he will compile it all to a video for her birthday.
