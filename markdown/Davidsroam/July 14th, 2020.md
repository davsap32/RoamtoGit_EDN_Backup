- A pleasure to wake up at home after our journey. [[Samuel]]called, we spoke about the situation for him and Josefine. He needs company and will bring the children here this afternoon. I have mixed feelings - of course we must support Samuel, at the same time I  am longing to do a deep dive into developing strategies for my Roam database.
- [[Lightroom]] keeps crashing - it starts after being reinstalled, but crashes again after being restarted. Frustrating. I edited my photos from Gotland, but the program crashed before I could upload them to Smugmug.

- [[Samuel]]was here during the afternoon with the children. He and I went fishing with Alice and Leo. Alice caught a couple of small perch, she took one home to us and  [[Samuel]]grilled it to eat on bread. We were fishing at a stony beach by Svängbågen, it was difficult to keep one's balance. Leo fell and hurt himself, after which we had to go back to our place for dinner. When [[Samuel]]and the children finally left at about 7 in the evening we were glad to see them go.

- Found a tick on my left arm after fishing with the grandchildren.
- After deleting [[Lightroom]], rebooting and reinstalling I could start the program. I   disabled the use of the graphics processor, as a lot of threads about this problem mention problems with [[Lightroom]] and graphics processor drivers.

- Spoke with [[Esther]] - she is in contact with both Josefin and [[Samuel]]and encouraging them about the therapy which they are about to start. 
- No time for reading today. 
- Watched a video by [[Conor White-Sullivan]] about using Roam for research. I felt that this was very relevant for what I want to do with Roam, to record and create relationships between my thoughts and conclusions as I read books and articles, listen to podcasts, watch videos etc.

- Fetched my new Inatek keyboard folio for my [[Ipad]] pro today. It seems to have good ergonomics for typing, but not for walking around with the [[Ipad]], as the keyboard flaps around behind the [[Ipad]] when it is folded backwards. Looking forward to testing it for [[Touch Typing]].
